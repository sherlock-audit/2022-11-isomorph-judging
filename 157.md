# Vault velo doesn't protect itself against volatile asset.

## Summary

The Vault Velo accepts volatile assets ([Deposit receipts eth](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/blob/1e9234236a/contracts/DepositReceipt_ETH.sol)) as a collateral, that means that the protocol could be in a losing position if the Ether price goes down.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Vault Velo, the ```openLoan()``` and ```increaseCollateralAmount()``` functions can receive deposit receipts based in Ether as a collateral. Those deposit receipts are susceptible if the Ether price goes down.

## Impact

Consider the next scenario:

- The borrower can deposit collateral in ether receipt valuated in $1200 and get $1100 isoUSD.
- The Ether goes down to $900.
- The borrower can decides not to repay the debt because it is not convenient since the Ether price dropped a lot. He can get the Ether in the market for $900 and make a $200 (isoUSD) as a profit.

Also, the [debt is ignored](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L556) if it is valued in less than 0.001 so the user can deposit Ether receipts and if the debt price goes down 0.001 the debt could be ignored.

## Code Snippet

- [DepositReceipt_ETH](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/blob/1e9234236a/contracts/DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L5)
- [Vault_Velo#OpenLoan()](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c897/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L397)
- [Debt is ignored if it is less than 0.001](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L556) 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is a interesting problem. I have some ideas:

- Consider different margin ratios if the collateral are deposit receipts based on volatile assets so the liquidation is possible in a best price. The deposit receipts in USD (stable asset) are diferrent from the deposit receipts in Ether (volatile asset) and the margin ratios should be different.
- Add a minimum borrow amount for the VaultVelo#OpenLoan() function like the [Vault Synths](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L121) in order to avoid the [ignoring debt](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L556).
