# ``RoleControl::removeRole`` should validate the removed account is not of the admin user

## Summary
The function which removes a role and its immediately executed has no validation that the removed address is the one used to add/propose new roles for the protocol to operate normally.

## Vulnerability Detail

``RoleControl`` is used by the ``CollateralBook`` when adding new vaults by assigning the ``VAULT_ROLE`` role to the vault addresses. This role permits the vault address to change the virtual price of the collateral.

And is laso used by ``isoUSDToken`` token when adding permission for a vault address to mint new tokens by assigning the ``MINTER`` role.

If just one admin of this two contract mistakenly loses the ability to add new roles with ``proposeAddRole`` (a 3 day time locked function) because he removed itself with ``removeRole`` (a function which is executed immediately) the protocol can not expand anymore itself by adding new vaults/collaterals.

## Impact
If it happens that one of the admin mistakenly removes itself from adding new roles the protocol cannot expand any more.

This can happen if just one of the admins loses this ability. The admin of ``CollateralBook`` or ``isoUSDToken``

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation that the admin cannot remove itself

```diff
    function removeRole(address _account, bytes32 _role) external onlyAdmin{
        require(hasRole(_role, _account), "Address was not already specified role");
+       require(!hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender), "Cannot remove admin");
        _revokeRole(_role, _account);
        emit RemoveRole(_account, _role, msg.sender);
    }
```
