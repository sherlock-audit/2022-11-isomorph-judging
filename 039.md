# User pays interests for the isoUsd that are sent to protocol as fees in Vault_Lyra

## Summary
When user creates new loan some amount of isoUsd are sent to protocol treasury as fee, but the whole amount is set as loan amount and user will pay fees for the isoUsd that he didn't receive.
## Vulnerability Detail
Vault_Lyra.openLoan function allows user to open new loan. _USDborrowed param is used to provide amount of isoUsd that user wants to receive.

```solidity
    function openLoan(
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _colAmount,
        uint256 _USDborrowed
        ) external override whenNotPaused 
        {
        _collateralExists(_collateralAddress);
        IERC20 collateral = IERC20(_collateralAddress);
        
        require(collateral.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= _colAmount, "User lacks collateral quantity!");
        //make sure virtual price is related to current time before fetching collateral details
        //slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-vulnerabilities-1
        _updateVirtualPrice(block.timestamp, _collateralAddress);  
        
        (   
            bytes32 currencyKey,
            uint256 minOpeningMargin,
            ,
            ,
            ,
            uint256 virtualPrice,
            
        ) = _getCollateral(_collateralAddress);
        //check for frozen or paused collateral
        _checkIfCollateralIsActive(currencyKey);
        //make sure the total isoUSD borrowed doesn't exceed the opening borrow margin ratio
        uint256 colInUSD = priceCollateralToUSD(currencyKey, _colAmount + collateralPosted[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]);
        uint256 totalUSDborrowed = _USDborrowed +  (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice)/LOAN_SCALE;
        uint256 borrowMargin = (totalUSDborrowed * minOpeningMargin) / LOAN_SCALE;
        require(colInUSD >= borrowMargin, "Minimum margin not met!");


        //update mappings with new loan amounts
        collateralPosted[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = collateralPosted[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] + _colAmount;
        isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] + _USDborrowed;
        isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] + ((_USDborrowed * LOAN_SCALE) / virtualPrice);
        
        emit OpenOrIncreaseLoan(msg.sender, _USDborrowed, currencyKey, _colAmount);


        //Now all effects are handled, transfer the assets so we follow CEI pattern
        _increaseCollateral(collateral, _colAmount);
        _increaseLoan(_USDborrowed);
        
        
    }
```

After some check you can see that the loaned amount of user is increased by _USDborrowed amount.
`isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] + _USDborrowed;`

But the problem is that later function _increaseLoan is called which should send isoUsd to borrower and this function will not send all _USDborrowed amount to borrower as it takes fees also.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L229-L240
```solidity
    function _increaseLoan(uint256 _loanAmount) internal {
        uint256 userMint;
        uint256 loanFee;
        _checkDailyMaxLoans(_loanAmount);
        (userMint, loanFee) = _findFees(loanOpenFee, _loanAmount);
        isoUSD.mint(_loanAmount);
        //isoUSD reverts on transfer failure so we can safely ignore slither's warnings for it.
        //slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
        isoUSD.transfer(msg.sender, userMint);
        //slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
        isoUSD.transfer(treasury, loanFee);
    }
```

As you can see some part of isoUsd tokens are sent to treasury.
But still all amount is set as user loan and he should pay interests for the money that he didn't receive.

Example.
1.User wants to open 100$ loan.
2.Protocol has 10% fee and sends 90$ to user and 10$ to treasury. Loan amount for user is set to 100$
3.User received only 90$, but pays interests for the loan of 100$.
## Impact
User pays more fees than he should.

## Recommendation
Set loan amount to the _USDborrowed - protocolFees.
