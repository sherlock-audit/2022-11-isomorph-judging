# Anyone can withdraw approved tokens from gauge

## Summary
Permissionless ```Depositor``` functions are vulnerable when mandatory approval is given.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user wants to withdraw from the gauge, approval must be given to the ```Depositor``` contract, because the ```Depositor``` calls ```depositReceipt``` to split or burn the NFT. ```depositReceipt``` contracts checks the caller:
```solidity
  require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _NFTId), "ERC721: caller is not token owner or approved");
```
However, this is not effective because the caller is the ```Depositor``` contract, not the actual user. The users are forced to make the approval because the ```msg.sender``` is ```Depositor``` contract so without approval it cannot ```burn``` or ```split``` the receipt NFT.

All the permissionless functions that rely on this approval are vulnerable: ```partialWithdrawFromGauge```, ```multiWithdrawFromGauge```, ```withdrawFromGauge```.

## Impact
Without approval, the users cannot retrieve their funds and once approval is given, anyone can front-run withdraw txs to steal funds on behalf of legitimate users.

## Code Snippet

I have expanded your test case to show this vulnerability:
```js
        it("Should fail if called by wrong user ", async function (){
             const NFT_id = 1;
             //setup deposit first
             const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther('0.00001')      
             await AMMToken.connect(owner).approve(depositor.address, amount)
             await depositor.connect(owner).depositToGauge(amount)
             rewards_address = ZERO_ADDRESS

             await depositReceipt.connect(owner).approve(depositor.address, NFT_id)

            await expect(depositor.connect(bob).withdrawFromGauge(NFT_id, [rewards_address])).to.be.revertedWith("ERC721: caller is not token owner or approved")
        });
```
The test passes successfully without revert showcasing the problem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```Depositor``` withdraw functions should not be permissionless. Only an owner / approved or special role (e.g. Vault) should be able to call it.
