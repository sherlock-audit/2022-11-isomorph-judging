# Inconsistent condition for `minOpeningMargin`



## Summary
The vault contracts validate the `minOpeningMargin` condition when users open or close loans.

Currently, it checks the condition inconsistently for opening and closing.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Vault_Lyra.openLoan()`, it checks the condition like below.

```solidity
    require(colInUSD >= borrowMargin, "Minimum margin not met!");
```

But in `Vault_Lyra.closeLoan()`, it checks differently.

```solidity
    require(colInUSD > borrowMargin , "Remaining debt fails to meet minimum margin!");
```

It's the same with `Vault_Synths` and `Vault_Velo` contracts also.

## Impact
It might work unexpectedly for some edge cases as it checks the different conditions while opening and closing loans.
