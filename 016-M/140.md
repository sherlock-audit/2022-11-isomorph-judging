# RoleControl TIME_DELAY may be not work

## Summary
RoleControl.sol There are two cases where the TIME_DELAY limit can be skipped.

## Vulnerability Detail

Added TIME_DELAY for security
There are two situations that can make this mechanism not work

1.RoleControl#addRole(account,role) does not have the restriction that role cannot be equal to AccessControl.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, when an account is set to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, the account can directly call AccessControl.grantRole() to register permissions, skipping TIME_DELAY

2.RoleControl#addRole(account,role) did not clear the "previous_action_hash" after success
This leads to the assumption that after "role_a" is added, it is #removeRole(role_a) for some reason, but since the previous_action_hash is still there, it is possible to directly call #addRole(role_a) again to skip TIME_DELAY

Due to the above two cases, we need to add the role limit and clear the previous_action_hash to avoid the failure of the TIME_DELAY mechanism

```solidity
    function addRole(address _account, bytes32 _role) external onlyAdmin{
       //***@audit can add role = DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE  (Super Administrator ) ****//
        bytes32 action_hash = keccak256(abi.encode(_account, _role, actionNonce-1));
        require(previous_action_hash == action_hash, "Invalid Hash");
        require(block.timestamp > action_queued[action_hash] + TIME_DELAY,
            "Not enough time has passed");
        //use a hash to verify proposed account is the same as added account.
        _setupRole(_role, _account);
        emit AddRole(_account, _role,  msg.sender);

         //****@audit don't clear previous_action_hash , can call again after #removeRole() ****//
    }
```

## Impact

skip "TIME_DELAY" to add role

```solidity
    function addRole(address _account, bytes32 _role) external onlyAdmin{
+       require(_role!=DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE,"not DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE");
        bytes32 action_hash = keccak256(abi.encode(_account, _role, actionNonce-1));
        require(previous_action_hash == action_hash, "Invalid Hash");
        require(block.timestamp > action_queued[action_hash] + TIME_DELAY,
            "Not enough time has passed");
+       delete action_queued[previous_action_hash];
+       delete previous_action_hash;
        //use a hash to verify proposed account is the same as added account.
        _setupRole(_role, _account);
        emit AddRole(_account, _role,  msg.sender);
    }
```
