# The calculation of totalUSDborrowed value is wrong in Vault Synths

## Summary
The calculation of totalUSDborrowed value is wrong in Vault Synths because of a typo.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
uint256 totalUSDborrowed = _USDborrowed +  (isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice)/LOAN_SCALE;
```

should be changed to

```solidity
uint256 totalUSDborrowed = _USDborrowed +  (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice)/LOAN_SCALE;
```

## Impact
This leads to a different coinInUSD value which will affect the result of the require checking a few lines after the code.

```solidity
require(colInUSD >= borrowMargin, "Minimum margin not met!");
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply the changes abovementioned. Kindly compare with vault lyra and vault velo. All these 3 vaults should share the similar logic.
