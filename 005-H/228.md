# Incorrect borrow margin calculation when increasing loan amount of Synth assets

## Summary
When we increase loan amount by calling `openLoan` on an already existing loan for Synth vault type, borrow margin calculation is incorrect which may cause unintended revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Borrow margin is calculated the following way:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L120-L123

However, the use of `isoUSDLoaned` here is incorrect. This mapping contains loan principal, while we want to use `isoUSDLoanAndInterest`.

Example: 
- Collateral virtual price is 1.05. Min margin is 1.8
- User opens a loan with 1000 sUSD collateral and borrows 500 isoUsd. Maximum he can borrow is 1000/1.8 = 555
- `isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]` is 500. `isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]` is 500/1.05 = 476
- User wants to borrow another 50 isoUsd and calls `openLoan`
- Call reverts because 500*1.05 + 50 = 575 which is bigger than 555
- If `isoUSDLoanAndInterest` was used instead then 476*1.05 + 50 = 550. Loan can be increased

The issue only happens when virtual price is > 0 at the time of opening the loan for the first time.

Added a failing test for this scenario: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph-kiseln/commit/74eaf381b205afd0fedcb03638e93361a3850f60

## Impact
Under certain conditions customers would be unable to increase loan amount.

## Recommendation
Change calculation to the following
```solidity
uint256 totalUSDborrowed = _USDborrowed +  (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice)/LOAN_SCALE;
require(totalUSDborrowed >= ONE_HUNDRED_DOLLARS, "Loan Requested too small"); 
uint256 borrowMargin = (totalUSDborrowed * minOpeningMargin) / LOAN_SCALE;
require(colInUSD >= borrowMargin, "Minimum margin not met!");
```
