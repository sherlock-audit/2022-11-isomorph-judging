# The precision of `tokenPrice` will affect the result of `priceCollateralToUSD()`

## Summary
The precision of `tokenPrice` will affect the result of `priceCollateralToUSD()`
## Vulnerability Detail
In `priceCollateralToUSD`, the value of price is taken from `LiquidityPool.getTokenPrice()`. Then `(_amount * tokenPrice) / LOAN_SCALE;` gets the value of USDvalue. But the problem of precision is not considered here. Because `LOAN_SCALE` is `1 ether`. That is 1e18. But if the precision of `tokenPrice` is not equal to 18 or less than 18. Then there is a problem with the results here.
For example, if it is less than 18, the value of `USDValue` will be rounded to 0

```solidity
    function priceCollateralToUSD(bytes32 _currencyKey, uint256 _amount) public view override returns(uint256){
         //The LiquidityPool associated with the LP Token is used for pricing
        ILiquidityPoolAvalon LiquidityPool = ILiquidityPoolAvalon(collateralBook.liquidityPoolOf(_currencyKey));
        //we have already checked for stale greeks so here we call the basic price function.
        uint256 tokenPrice = LiquidityPool.getTokenPrice();          
        uint256 withdrawalFee = _getWithdrawalFee(LiquidityPool);
        uint256 USDValue  = (_amount * tokenPrice) / LOAN_SCALE; //@audit 
        //we remove the Liquidity Pool withdrawalFee 
        //as there's no way to remove the LP position without paying this.
        uint256 USDValueAfterFee = USDValue * (LOAN_SCALE- withdrawalFee)/LOAN_SCALE;
        return(USDValueAfterFee);
    }
```
