# Incorrect `_liquidityPool` setting can cause system confusion

## Summary
Incorrect `_liquidityPool` setting can cause system confusion
## Vulnerability Detail
In `collateralBook::addCollateralType`, administrators can set `liquidityPoolOf[_currencyKey]` to the specified `_liquidityPool` address. But there are two problems here

1. `_liquidityPool` does not judge whether it is address(0). If it is set to 0 address, it will cause `priceCollateralToUSD()` and `_checkIfCollateralIsActive()` functions to fail to run.
```solidity
    function priceCollateralToUSD(bytes32 _currencyKey, uint256 _amount) public view override returns(uint256){
         //The LiquidityPool associated with the LP Token is used for pricing
        ILiquidityPoolAvalon LiquidityPool = ILiquidityPoolAvalon(collateralBook.liquidityPoolOf(_currencyKey));
        //we have already checked for stale greeks so here we call the basic price function.
        uint256 tokenPrice = LiquidityPool.getTokenPrice();          
        uint256 withdrawalFee = _getWithdrawalFee(LiquidityPool);
        uint256 USDValue  = (_amount * tokenPrice) / LOAN_SCALE;
        //we remove the Liquidity Pool withdrawalFee 
        //as there's no way to remove the LP position without paying this.
        uint256 USDValueAfterFee = USDValue * (LOAN_SCALE- withdrawalFee)/LOAN_SCALE;
        return(USDValueAfterFee);
    }
```


2. There is no restriction on the uniqueness of `_currencyKey` and `_liquidityPool`. If the administrator makes a mistake, multiple `_currencyKey` will be assigned to the same `_liquidityPool` address. Then the state of the same LiquidityPool, such as `tokenprice`, will affect different collaterals. cause system confusion.

```solidity
    function priceCollateralToUSD(bytes32 _currencyKey, uint256 _amount) public view override returns(uint256){
         //The LiquidityPool associated with the LP Token is used for pricing
        ILiquidityPoolAvalon LiquidityPool = ILiquidityPoolAvalon(collateralBook.liquidityPoolOf(_currencyKey));
        //we have already checked for stale greeks so here we call the basic price function.
        uint256 tokenPrice = LiquidityPool.getTokenPrice();          
        uint256 withdrawalFee = _getWithdrawalFee(LiquidityPool);
        uint256 USDValue  = (_amount * tokenPrice) / LOAN_SCALE;
        //we remove the Liquidity Pool withdrawalFee 
        //as there's no way to remove the LP position without paying this.
        uint256 USDValueAfterFee = USDValue * (LOAN_SCALE- withdrawalFee)/LOAN_SCALE;
        return(USDValueAfterFee);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Determine whether _liquidityPool is address(0)
2. The _liquidityPool address that has been used cannot be used again
