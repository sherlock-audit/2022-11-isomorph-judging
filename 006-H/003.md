# Missing sanity check to ensure that the currency key isn't already used on existing collateral token.

## Summary
Missing sanity check to ensure that the currency key isn't already used on existing collateral token.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no sanity check in the function `addCollateralType()` to ensure that the currency key isn't already used on an existing collateral token. As a result the currency key will lead to two collateral tokens and the address of the liquidity pool for the second collateral token will override the address of the liquidity pool from the first one in the mapping 
`mapping(bytes32 => address) public liquidityPoolOf`.

This action will lead to problems occurring in the vault, as one currency key leads to two collateral tokens and one of the collateral tokens uses the address of a wrong liquidity pool to check the token price and if collateral is still active.

## Impact
The issue described in "Vulnerability Detail" can lead to problems occurring in the vault, as there is no sanity check in `addCollateralType()` to ensure that the currency key wasn't already used on other collateral token.

## Recommendation
Add a sanity check to ensure that the currency key isn't already used on an existing token.

There seems to be missing check for that in the function `queueCollateralChange()` too, might want to add the check there as well.
