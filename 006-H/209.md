# Missing or not entirely correct validations

## Summary
I have noticed several validations missing or not robust enough in the protocol that could impact the behavior and lead to unexpected results. I have grouped all of them together in this one submission.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. ```addCollateralType``` and ```queueCollateralChange``` should validate the ``` _interestPer3Min >= DIVISION_BASE (1e18)```, otherwise the ```virtualPrice``` will always be 0 (or impossible to update):
```solidity
  collateral.virtualPrice = (collateral.virtualPrice * collateral.interestPer3Min) / DIVISION_BASE;
```

2. ```_checkDailyMaxLoans``` should be ```<=```:
```solidity
  require( dailyTotal  < dailyMax, "Try again tomorrow loan opening limit hit");
```

3. ```closeLoan``` should be ```>=```:
```solidity
  require(colInUSD > borrowMargin , "Remaining debt fails to meet minimum margin!");
```

4. ```getOraclePrice``` price boundaries should be inclusive ```<=``` and ```>=```:
```solidity
        require(signedPrice < _maxPrice, "Upper price bound breached");
        require(signedPrice > _minPrice, "Lower price bound breached");
```

5. ```getOraclePrice``` does not validate stale round ```require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale round");```:
```solidity
        (
            /*uint80 roundID*/,
            int signedPrice,
            /*uint startedAt*/,
            uint timeStamp,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = _priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

6. ```vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime``` does not verify the invariant mentioned in the docs:
"Vaults should only be able to interact with the collateral relating to their AssetType."
```solidity
    function vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _virtualPriceUpdate,
        uint256 _updateTime
    ) external onlyVault collateralExists(_collateralAddress){
        _updateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, _virtualPriceUpdate, _updateTime);
    }
```
should have something like this:
```solidity
  require(msg.sender == vaults[collateralProps[_collateralAddress].assetType], "...");
```

7. ```addCollateralType``` does not check if ```liquidityPoolOf[_currencyKey]``` already exists, it always overrides with a new one:
```solidity
  liquidityPoolOf[_currencyKey]= _liquidityPool;
```

8. ```callLiquidation``` could have a slippage control parameter where liquidators can specify what minimum reward amount satisfies them.

9. Synths ```closeLoan``` does not validate that if not all the loan is repaid, the remaining USD borrowed is ```>= ONE_HUNDRED_DOLLARS```.

10. ```closeLoan``` and ```callLiquidation``` in Velo vault does not validate that ```_loanNFTs``` entries are unique (not repeated).

## Impact

All these missing validations could result in a protocol misbehaving if these edge conditions are triggered.

For example, if the virtual price becomes 0, it will be impossible to open new or close existing loans or even liquidate because the interest calculation will revert (division by 0):
```solidity
  isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] + ((_USDborrowed * LOAN_SCALE) / virtualPrice);
```
