# Vault_velo should allow loans operations for approved operators of Deposited nft

## Summary
Vault_velo should allow loans operations for approved operators of Deposited nft. Now only the owner can do that.
## Vulnerability Detail
Vault_velo contract currently allows only the owner of DepositReceipt nft to use loan operations(open loan, increase collateral, close loan). 
For example, in openLoan function, call is approved only for [nft owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L399).
However according to ERC721 approved operators of DepositReceipt nft should also be able to use such operations on behalf of nft owner. So i believe open loan, increase collateral, close loan operations should be available to call by approved operators of DepositReceipt nft.
## Impact
Approved operators can't execute actions on behalf of nft owner.
