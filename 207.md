# Impossible to liquidate if collateral price drops to 0

## Summary
If for some reason the price of collateral becomes 0 the calculation of the liquidatable amount will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating the liquidatable amount a denominator relies on the current ```_collateralPrice```:
```solidity
    function viewLiquidatableAmount(
        uint256 _collateralAmount,
        uint256 _collateralPrice,
        uint256 _userDebt,
        uint256 _liquidatableMargin
        ) public pure returns(uint256){
        uint256 minimumCollateralPoint = _userDebt*_liquidatableMargin;
        uint256 actualCollateralPoint = _collateralAmount*_collateralPrice;
        if(minimumCollateralPoint <=  actualCollateralPoint){
            //in this case the loan is not liquidatable at all and so we return zero
            return 0;
        }
        uint256 numerator =  minimumCollateralPoint - actualCollateralPoint; 
        uint256 denominator = (_collateralPrice*LIQUIDATION_RETURN*_liquidatableMargin/LOAN_SCALE - _collateralPrice*LOAN_SCALE)/LOAN_SCALE;
        return(numerator  / denominator);

    }
```
The denominator is 0 when ```_collateralPrice``` is 0, and the division by 0 will revert.
This might happen when the collateral might become useless (e.g. in case of external exploit and crash).

This is only valid for Synths and Lyra vaults, Velo always hardcodes ```1 ether``` as the price.

## Impact

It is very unlikely, but if for some reason the collateral lost all of its value, it would be impossible to liquidate such positions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Handle the special case when the ```_collateralPrice``` is 0.
