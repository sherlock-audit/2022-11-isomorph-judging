# Misconfiguration in RoleControl constructor of isoUSDToken

## Summary

Misconfiguration in isoUSDToken that it hardcodes a wrong time delay value.

## Vulnerability Detail

The comment shows that the `ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY` should be days, but it's only set `3` which means 3 seconds. Itâ€™s not reasonable for the 3 seconds time delay.

## Impact

Admins only need to wait 3 seconds to call `addRole`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```solidity
uint256 constant ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY = 3 days; // days;
```
