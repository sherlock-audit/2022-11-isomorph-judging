# Vault_Base_ERC20._updateVirtualPrice allows to skip some price updates

## Summary
Vault_Base_ERC20._updateVirtualPrice allows to skip some price updates
## Vulnerability Detail
Vault_Base_ERC20._updateVirtualPrice function is created to updated virtual price of collateral and last updated time.
By design virtual price should be changed once per 3 minutes(increases) and in such way interests for the protocol are accrued.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L203-L221
```solidity
    function _updateVirtualPrice(uint256 _currentBlockTime, address _collateralAddress) internal { 
        (   ,
            ,
            ,
            uint256 interestPer3Min,
            uint256 lastUpdateTime,
            uint256 virtualPrice,


        ) = _getCollateral(_collateralAddress);
        uint256 timeDelta = _currentBlockTime - lastUpdateTime;
        //exit gracefully if two users call the function for the same collateral in the same 3min period
        uint256 threeMinuteDelta = timeDelta / 180; 
        if(threeMinuteDelta > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < threeMinuteDelta; i++ ){
            virtualPrice = (virtualPrice * interestPer3Min) / LOAN_SCALE; 
            }
            collateralBook.vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, virtualPrice, _currentBlockTime);
        }
    }
```
In this function first we calculate how much time have passed since last update and then divide it by 3 minutes period.
Then [we update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L231-L251) virtual price and set new virtual price(that we calculated) and new last updated timestamp(tx time).

Vault_Base_ERC20._updateVirtualPrice function is called from Vault_Lyra contract and Vault_Synths in functions that should update virtual price of collateral asset before calculations. And they always [provide](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L165) block.timestamp as _currentBlockTime param.

So here is the problem.
1.In time 0 seconds user opens new loan.
2.In time 5 minutes 59 seconds user makes another loan action. 359 seconds / 180 = 1, so only 1 time virtual price will be increased. But last updated timestamp is set to block.timestamp.
3.In time 6 minutes user makes loan action. But this time virtual price will no be increased, as last update was just 1 sec ago.
As result collateral virtual price was updated only 1 time during 6 minutes, but should be updated 2 times. Protocol lost some fees.
## Impact
Lost of fees for the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update last update param as it is done in [CollateralBook)(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L270) and do not provide block.timestamp.
