# No check for active Optimism Sequencer in the Oracle code

## Summary

No check for active Optimism Sequencer in the Oracle code

## Vulnerability Detail

I want to quote from the doc:

DEPLOYMENT: optimism

Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle

If the Optimism Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. However, users are able to continue to interact with the protocol directly through the L1 optimistic rollup contract. You can review Chainlink docs on [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/) for more details on this.

## Impact

If the Optimism sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates.

## Recommendation

Add check to make sure the sequencer is alive before using the oracle data:
