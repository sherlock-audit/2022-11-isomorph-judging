# Chainlink's latestRoundData might return stale results

## Summary
Chainlink's latestRoundData might return stale results.

## Vulnerability Detail
RoundId is the identifier of the new returned price every round. We need to ensure that every Chainlink's price retrieval has a new roundId and if not, we are querying the stale price.

## Impact
We might retrieve the state results.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the code from

```solidity
 (
  /*uint80 roundID*/,
  int signedPrice,
  /*uint startedAt*/,
  uint timeStamp,
  /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
) = _priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

to      

```solidity
 (
    uint80 roundID,
    int signedPrice,
    /*uint startedAt*/,
    uint timeStamp,
    uint80 answeredInRound
) = _priceFeed.latestRoundData();
     
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
```
