# Removed Minter Address can be set again

## Summary
The project in describing removing of the minter role via `removeRole ()` function stated `removeRole Removing a role has no timelock, the action is instantanious to give a method to react to an account being hijacked in some way`. Therefore, it should not be possible for addresses which already has been removed as minters to be able to become minter address again. The `_revokeRole` method called in the `removeRole ()` function, only uses boolean expressions `True` and `False` to determined if an address has a certain role or not. As a result, an address which has been removed from minter role can still be added via the `addRole ()` function by the admin. 

Considering the projects intention via its documentation, it should not be possible for addresses which have been removed as minters to be able to be added as minters again in future. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `removeRole ()` function, calls the `_revokeRole ()` function which uses boolean expression `false` in revoking roles. As such, the same address can be set to `True` by the admin via the `proposeAddRole ()` and `addRole ()` functions. 

This is only mentioned because in its documentation, the contract intends to use the `removeRole ()` function for hijacked or malicious minters and as such, such it should not be possible to add such addresses as minters in the future.

## Recommendation
Consider storing addresses removed from minter roles in a list and check against this list before in proposing an address for the minter role.
