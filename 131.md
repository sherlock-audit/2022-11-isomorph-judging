# User can use flashloan to open position and exit position without paying the interest because the interest compound every 3 minutes

## Summary

A vulnerability has been identified in the Vault_Lyra.sol smart contract, which is part of the isomorph.loans system. This vulnerability allows an attacker to use a flash loan to avoid paying interest on a debt position.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is that the interest on a debt position only compounds every three minutes, and a flash loan can be used to open, mint, and close the debt position at the same block transaction, allowing the attacker to avoid paying the interest.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to avoid paying interest on a debt position, potentially resulting in a financial loss for the isomorph.loans system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, the smart contract should be updated to prevent the use of flash loans to avoid paying interest on a debt position. One possible solution is to modify the contract to compound interest more frequently, such as every block, to prevent attackers from using flash loans to avoid paying the interest.

and avoid the user to open and close the position within the transaction / block
