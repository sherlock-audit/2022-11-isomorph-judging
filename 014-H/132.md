# Vaults are not checking that the collateral it is interacting with belongs to itself

## Summary
We first note the invariant of Isomorph listed [here](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/docs/Invariants.md), specifically this line.
> Vaults should only be able to interact with the collateral relating to their AssetType.

We also note in `Vault_Base`, `enum AssetType` should be used to revert if vault is used to interact with wrong collateral.
>    //Enums// collateral type identifiers to revert if the wrong collateral is interacted with by the wrong Vault.
    enum AssetType {Synthetix_Synth, Lyra_LP} 

`_assetType` is a variable of a `Collateral`, but is not used in all 3 of the vaults to ensure that interaction with a different collateral than the intended is not possible in `openLoan()`, `closeLoan()`, `callLiquidation()` etc.

I have confirmed this issue with the sponsor.



## Vulnerability Detail
For example, Vault_Lyra#openLoan checks `_collateralExists`, `_checkIfCollateralIsActive`. Checks of `collateralBook.assetType` is not found. This is true for all 3 of the vaults and the other functions as well in `closeLoan()`, `callLiquidation()` etc.

## Impact
While the current vaults do not allow cross interaction despite the lack of this check due to various differences in the collateral types, for example, a `Velo` or `Synth` collateral do not have a liquidity pool assigned and will revert if we try to open a loan in `Vault_Lyra` with either of these collaterals due to `_checkIfCollateralIsActive()`. Similarly, we cannot open a loan using a `Lyra` collateral on `Vault_Synth` as it does not have a `synthetixExchangeRates` and will not be able to price the collateral with `priceCollateralToUSD()`.

However, leaving it this way can lead to many unexpected or unknown issues. It can also be the cause to new critical issues if future vaults are deployed with collateral type that do not differ too much from the current collaterals used, such that `openLoan()` does not revert. Note that should this happen, a malicious user can open 2 loans using the same collateral on 2 different vaults, which would be extremely damaging to the protocol. 

Due to not strictly following the invariant stated, as well as causing expected issues and potentially severe ones in the future should new vaults be added, I find medium severity to be appropriate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend checking in the individual vaults in each of the operations to ensure that the collateral it is being interacted with is indeed the expected one, as given in `collateral._assetType`.
