# any vault can change the virtual price of any other collateral

## Summary
``CollateralBook`` contract keeps track of the ``virtualPrice`` used per each used vault. This price inside ``CollateralBook`` can be changed every three minutes by an address that has been given the role of ``VAULT_ROLE``.

In the case of pausing/resuming a collateral using ``pauseCollateralType/unpauseCollateralType`` we can see that the ``_currencyKey`` parameter is used in precaution that we are changing the right collateral.

In the case of a vault changing the virtual price there is no such checking and in a case of a misbehaving vault it can change any virtual price by calling ``vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime``.

This ``vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime`` function that allows the change of price **does not emit any event** signaling who, how much and when the virtual price changed. In a case of a misbehaving vault there would be very difficult to undo such operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The change of a virtual price per collateral can happen by any address that has ``VAULT_ROLE`` :

The only checking are that the calling address has ``VAULT_ROLE`` and that the update time and price are bigger than previous one given:

When a **vault is added to the system currently there is no implementation for removing such address nor removing its ``VAULT_ROLE`` permissions**.

## Impact
Vaults can change other collateral virtual prices which can have bad consequences for this protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Every added collateral has a vault assigned by the ``assetType`` attribute.

I would suggest to use this information to check that a vault changing the virtual price its indeed changing only the price of the assigned collateral.

Something like this:

```diff
    function vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _virtualPriceUpdate,
        uint256 _updateTime
    ) external onlyVault collateralExists(_collateralAddress){
+        address collateralVault = vaults[collateralProps[_collateralAddress].assetType];
+
+        require(msg.sender == collateralVault, "vault try to change wrong collateral");
+
        _updateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, _virtualPriceUpdate, _updateTime);
    }
```
