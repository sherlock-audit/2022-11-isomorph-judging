# Vaults do not check assetType of collateral

## Summary
The `Vault_Base_ERC20` contract defines an enum of asset types.
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L42-L43](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L42-L43)

According to the comment in line 42, a Vault should revert if it interacts with the wrong asset type.
E.g. the Lyra Vault should check that the asset type returned by the collateral book is `Lyra_LP` and revert if it is not `Lyra_LP`.

However the Vaults do not check the asset type.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `assetType` is a member of the `Collateral` struct in `CollateralBook.sol`:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L37-L46](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L37-L46)

The collateral properties are accessed in the Vaults by the `_getCollateral` function:
`Vault_Base_ERC20`:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L164-L183](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L164-L183)

`Vault_Velo`:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L218-L229](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L218-L229)

The `Vault_Velo` contract fails to return the `assetType` from the `_getCollateral` function.
While the `Vault_Base_ERC20` function returns the `assetType` from the `getCollateral` function, the `assetType` is not used to perform a check that the right Vault uses the right assetType.

## Impact
Right now there does not seem to be an immediate issue because the different Vaults employ different pricing mechanisms such that the wrong collateral will not receive a valid price.
However as more collaterals are added to the system, a collateral might receive a valid price from more than one Vault contract.
This means that a loan can be opened in a vault that is supposed to not handle this collateral type.

This can cause a lot of issues. Potentially a user might not have to add sufficient colllateral because the collateral is not priced correctly.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Whenever a use wants to interact with a collateral in a vault (openLoan, closeLoan, increaseCollateralAmount, callLiquidation), it should be checked whether the collateral is supposed to by handled by that vault using the assetType from the collateral book.
