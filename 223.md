# Velodrome pool price manipulation can force users into liquidations

## Summary
Velodrome pool price manipulation can force users into liquidations
## Vulnerability Detail
The `priceLiquidity` functions of `DepositReceipt_USDC` and `DepositReceipt_ETH` calculate the value of liquidity provided into a Velodrome pool and used as a collateral in the Velodrome vault. The functions call `router.getAmountOut` to determine token prices in respective pools on Velodrome ([DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L87](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L87), [DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L110](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L110), [DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L104](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L104), [DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L132](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L132)):
```solidity
(amountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(HUNDRED_TOKENS, token1, USDC);
```

The `getAmountOut` function uses the current pool reserves to calculate output amounts ([Pair.sol#L416-L435](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/master/contracts/Pair.sol#L416-L435)) and this was the cause of many price manipulation attacks in the past. For example, a flash loan can be taken to manipulate the price of a pool at an advantage of an attacker. Another example is when a big share of liquidity is removed from a pool and the pool becomes subject to high slippage and price volatility.

The `priceLiquidity` functions use pool prices as a reference to check Chainlink prices against and revert if a deviation is too big ([DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L87-L98](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L87-L98)):
```solidity
(amountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(HUNDRED_TOKENS, token1, USDC);
require(stablePool == stable, "pricing occuring through wrong pool" );

uint256 oraclePrice = getOraclePrice(priceFeed, tokenMaxPrice, tokenMinPrice);
amountOut = (amountOut * oracleBase) / USDC_BASE / HUNDRED; //shift USDC amount to same scale as oracle

//calculate acceptable deviations from oracle price
uint256 lowerBound = (oraclePrice * (BASE - ALLOWED_DEVIATION)) / BASE;
uint256 upperBound = (oraclePrice * (BASE + ALLOWED_DEVIATION)) / BASE;
//because 1 USDC = $1 we can compare its amount directly to bounds
require(lowerBound < amountOut, "Price shift low detected");
require(upperBound > amountOut, "Price shift high detected");
```

This opens up the following attack scenario:
1. A liquidator, seeing that a borrower's position is getting closer to the liquidation threshold, manipulates the price of an underlying Velodrome pool.
1. The borrower calls `increaseCollateralAmount` to save their position from liquidation ([Vault_Velo.sol#L459](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L459)) but it reverts because the price of the underlying Velodrome pool has deviated from the price reported by Chainlink (collateral is priced using the `priceLiquidity` functions when added: [Vault_Velo.sol#L473](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L473)).
1. The liquidator manipulates the price of a pool again to reduce the deviation and liquidate the borrower's position.

## Impact
Liquidators can manipulate the prices of Velodrome pools to lock borrowers out of increasing collateral and to force them into liquidations.

## Code Snippet
Both `priceLiquidity` functions of `DepositReceipt_USDC` and `DepositReceipt_ETH` are affected: [DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L75](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L75), [DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L93](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L93).

## Recommendation
Consider using TWAP prices of Velodrome pools by calling `Pair.quote`: [Pair.sol#L255-L262](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/master/contracts/Pair.sol#L255-L262). `Router.pairFor` can be used to find a pair by token addresses: [Router.sol#L47-L55](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/master/contracts/Router.sol#L47-L55).
