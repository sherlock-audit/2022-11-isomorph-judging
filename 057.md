# Outstanding loans cannot be closed or liquidated if collateral is paused

## Summary

When a collateral is paused by governance, `collateralValid` is set to false. This causes closing and liquidating of loans to be impossible, leading to two issues. The first is that users with exist loans are unable to close their loans to recover their collateral. The second is that since debt is impossible to liquidate the protocol could end up being stuck with a lot of bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function pauseCollateralType(
        address _collateralAddress,
        bytes32 _currencyKey
        ) external collateralExists(_collateralAddress) onlyAdmin {
        require(_collateralAddress != address(0)); //this should get caught by the collateralExists check but just to be careful
        //checks two inputs to help prevent input mistakes
        require( _currencyKey == collateralProps[_collateralAddress].currencyKey, "Mismatched data");
        collateralValid[_collateralAddress] = false;
        collateralPaused[_collateralAddress] = true;
    }

When a collateral is paused `collateralValid[_collateralAddress]` is set to `false`. For `Vault_Lyra` `Vault_Synths` and `Vault_Velo` this will cause `closeLoan` and `callLiquidation` to revert. This traps existing users and prevents liquidations which will result in bad debt for the protocol

## Impact

Outstanding loans cannot be closed or liquidated, freezing user funds and causing the protocol to take on bad debt
