# Vault_Base_ERC20.sol : viewLiquidatableAmount could be slightly higher due to calculation that lead to truncation.

## Summary

[viewLiquidatableAmount ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L395) is used to calculate the amount that is used for liquidation. The returned value could be slightly higher due to truncation of `numerator` value.

Before multiplication, division is done. Solidity will truncate the actual value.

Because of this, the calculated `denominator` value slighlty lesser than actual. This directly affects the final outcome.

        return(numerator  / denominator);

The final value will be slightly higher than actual  value.

## Recommendation

Do multiplication and then perform division.

        uint256 denominator = ((_collateralPrice*LIQUIDATION_RETURN*_liquidatableMargin)/LOAN_SCALE - _collateralPrice*LOAN_SCALE)/LOAN_SCALE;
