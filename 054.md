# Vault_Lyra.closeLoan do not remove interests if outstanding debt is les than TENTH_OF_CENT

## Summary
Vault_Lyra.closeLoan do not remove interests if outstanding debt is les than TENTH_OF_CENT. As result the loan is closed, but interests continue accumulating.
## Vulnerability Detail
Vault_Lyra.closeLoan allows user to repay his loan.
The loan is [considered repayed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L230-L235) if outstanding debt is less than TENTH_OF_CENT amount. In such case user can get all his collateral assets back.

However in case when user still has smaller than TENTH_OF_CENT debt, the interests will still continue accumulating as `isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]` will not be set to 0 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L252). It will be still some small positive amount.
And as result the loan is closed, but interests are still accumulating and when user will open new loan is soe time he can find some amount of fees already accrued.
## Impact
The loan is closed, but interests accumulating.

## Recommendation
Delete isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] if outstanding debt is less than TENTH_OF_CENT as it [is done](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L314) in callLiquidation function
