# if the ``_interestPer3Min`` is not validated for maximal value the collateral can become unusable

## Summary
In adding a new collateral the parameter ``_interestPer3Min`` is not checked for a maximal value. If a mistake is made and interest is set to high the code to set a new virtual price and also updating the collateral that is using this parameter will revert with an overflow exception.

## Vulnerability Detail
The collateral is added with ``addCollateralType``

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L288-L320

we can see that the parameter ``_interestPer3Min`` is not checked for a maximal value.

Inside ``updateVirtualPriceSlowly`` function which is used for collateral properties update (by calling ``changeCollateralType``) and for updating the virtual price (by calling ``vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime`` or ``updateVirtualPriceSlowly``)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L267-L269

the calculation inside the loop will overflow in the case interestPer3Min is too big

```solidity
    collateral.virtualPrice = (collateral.virtualPrice * collateral.interestPer3Min) / DIVISION_BASE;
```

**Notice**: this can be prevented if the owner spots its mistake before three minutes are passed. In such case the function ``changeCollateralType`` will successfully change the offending ``interestPer3Min`` collateral attribute to a lower value.

## Impact
If the attribute ``interestPer3Min`` is set to high and this is not noticed before three minutes are passed the code to change the collateral or update the virtual price will not work.

In such case this not working collateral is to be discarded by ``pauseCollateralType`` and create a new collateral with the corrected parameter.

## Code Snippet
If for example we set the ``_interestPer3Min`` parameter by calling ``addCollateralType`` to ``type(uint).max``

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L288-L320

the add function will succeed. And after three minutes has passed all of the function below will fail.

Rendering this collateral unusable.

## Recommendation
Add a maximum value validation when settings the collateral interest parameter.
