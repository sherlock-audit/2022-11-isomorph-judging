# liquidation ration when adding a collateral is not correctly checked

## Summary
When adding a new collateral is checked that a vault has enough liquidation return for the collateral liquidation ration. 

The same vault can be used in more then one collateral but the check is used as there is just one collateral used.

## Vulnerability Detail
By adding a new collateral with ``addCollateralType`` the vault minimal liquidation ratio is checked with

If we add another collateral wit the same vault the same check is used but the vault is now divided between two liquidation rations of two collaterals used.


## Impact
By adding new collateral to the same vault it can happen that we don't have enough liquidation to return and in the worst case it can overflow in ``callLiquidation`` function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When adding new collateral sum all the liquidation rations (``_liquidationRatio``) already used for a vault and check that is not higher than the vault ``LIQUIDATION_RETURN`` value.

Something like this.
```diff
        //prevent setting liquidationRatio too low such that it would cause an overflow in callLiquidation, see appendix on liquidation maths for details.
-        require( vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio >= 10 ** 36, "Liquidation ratio too low"); //i.e. 1 when multiplying two 1 ether scale numbers.
+       mapOfVaultLR[vault].add(_liquidationRatio);
+       uint256 allVaultLR = sum(mapOfVaultLR[vault]);
+        require( vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() * allVaultLR >= 10 ** 36, "Liquidation ratio too low");

        collateralValid[_collateralAddress] = true;
```

A mapping is used here instead of just a variable because the code needs more consideration. For example what happens if a collateral is paused does it still counts etc..
