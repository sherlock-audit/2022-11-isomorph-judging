# Incorrect caller verification in addRole and removeRole functions

## Summary
The **addRole** and **removeRole** functions in the **RoleControl** contract do not correctly verify the caller of the function. In the **addRole** function, the caller is not verified against the address that was passed to the **proposeAddRole** function, which means that anyone who knows the hash of the action can add themselves (or any other address) as a role, even if they were not the one who proposed it. In the **removeRole** function, the caller is not verified against the address that is being removed from the role, which means that anyone who knows the address of an account with a particular role can remove that role from the account, even if they are not the account owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Deploy the **RoleControl** contract.
2. Call the **proposeAddRole** function with an address A and a role R.
3. Calculate the hash of the action by keccak256 hashing the concatenation of A, R, and the current value of **actionNonce**.
4. Call the **addRole** function with the address A, the role R, and the calculated hash.
5. Observe that the role R has been added to the address A, even though the caller of the **addRole** function is not the same address that was passed to the **proposeAddRole** function.

## Impact
Allowing anyone who knows the hash of an action to add themselves (or any other address) as a role can potentially enable unauthorized access to sensitive functions in the contract. Allowing anyone who knows the address of an account with a particular role to remove that role from the account can potentially enable unauthorized removal of roles from accounts, which could lead to loss of access or other security issues.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, I would recommend adding caller verification checks to the **addRole** and **removeRole** functions. In the **addRole** function, I would add a check to verify that the caller of the function is the same address that was passed to the **proposeAddRole** function. This will ensure that only the address that proposed the role can add it. In the **removeRole** function, I would add a check to verify that the caller of the function is the same address that is being removed from the role. This will ensure that only the account owner can remove roles from their own account.

Example code for the updated **addRole** and **removeRole** functions:
```solidity
function addRole(address _account, bytes32 _role) external onlyAdmin{
    bytes32 action_hash = keccak256(abi.encode(_account, _role, actionNonce-1));
    require(previous_action_hash == action_hash, "Invalid Hash");
    require(block.timestamp > action_queued[action_hash] + TIME_DELAY,
        "Not enough time has passed");
    // Add caller verification check
    require(msg.sender == _account, "Caller is not the address that was passed to proposeAddRole");
    //use a hash to verify proposed account is the same as added account.
    _setupRole(_role, _account);
    emit AddRole(_account, _role,  msg.sender);
}

function removeRole(address _account, bytes32 _role) external onlyAdmin{
```
