# viewLiquidatableAmount's divison by zero error revert the liquidation transaction.

## Summary
This report details a vulnerability in the viewLiquidatableAmount function of a smart contract. The function contains a division by zero issue that can cause the contract to throw an exception.

## Vulnerability Detail
The viewLiquidatableAmount function contains a division by zero issue. This issue occurs when the denominator variable is 0, which can happen if the _collateralPrice variable is 0 or if the value of LIQUIDATION_RETURN is equal to the value of LOAN_SCALE. If the denominator variable is 0, the contract will throw an exception.

## Impact
If this issue is not addressed, the contract may throw exceptions, potentially leading to incorrect decisions or other issues in the contract or any contracts that interact with it and transaction revert when user tries to liquidate the position.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix the division by zero issue, the denominator variable should be checked for a value of 0 before performing the division. If the denominator variable is 0, the function should return 0. For example:

```solidity
function viewLiquidatableAmount(
    uint256 _collateralAmount,
    uint256 _collateralPrice,
    uint256 _userDebt,
    uint256 _liquidatableMargin
    ) public pure returns(uint256){
    uint256 minimumCollateralPoint = _userDebt*_liquidatableMargin;
    uint256 actualCollateralPoint = _collateralAmount*_collateralPrice;
    if(minimumCollateralPoint <=  actualCollateralPoint){
        //in this case the loan is not liquidatable at all and so we return zero
        return 0;
    }
    uint256 numerator =  minimumCollateralPoint - actualCollateralPoint; 
    uint256 denominator = (_collateralPrice*LIQUIDATION_RETURN*_liquidatableMargin/LOAN_SCALE - _collateralPrice*LOAN_SCALE)/LOAN_SCALE;
    if (denominator == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return(numerator  / denominator);

}
```
