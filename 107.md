# Assumption of Chainlink USD oracle always having 8 decimal is wrong.

## Summary
#DepositReceipt assumes that Chainlink USD oracle have 8 decimals as we see in the comment "Chainlink USD oracles have 8d.p.". It then assumes that `ETHOracleDecimals == tokenPriceFeed.decimals()` in our constructor. This severely limits the type of Chainlink oracles we can use. It can also be the case that both `ETHOracleDecimals` and `tokenPriceFeed.decimals()` are 18 decimals if they are both non ETH pairs.

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink price feed returns 18 decimals for non ETH pairs, i.e. AAVE/ETH, and returns 8 decimals for ETH pairs, i.e. ETH/USD. By requiring `ETHOracleDecimals == tokenPriceFeed.decimals()`, we are limiting price feed to only ETH pairs. Furthermore, if price feed used are both `18 decimals` instead, `valueOut` will be wrongly calculated in `priceLiquidity()` as it scales down the value of `amountOut` to `1e8`. We see in the code snippet below.

```solidity
function priceLiquidity(uint256 _liquidity) external override view returns(uint256){
            ...
            (amountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(HUNDRED_TOKENS, token1, WETH);
            ...
            uint256 tokenOraclePrice = getOraclePrice(tokenPriceFeed, tokenMaxPrice, tokenMinPrice);
            uint256 ETHOraclePrice = getOraclePrice(ETHPriceFeed, ETHMaxPrice, ETHMinPrice);
            //reduce amountOut to the value of one token in dollars in the same scale as tokenOraclePrice (1e8)
            uint256 valueOut = amountOut * ETHOraclePrice / HUNDRED / BASE;  
            ...
```


## Impact
`priceLiquidity()` will always revert as the wrongly calculated value will fall out of the boundaries due to the wrong decimal values. 
>require(lowerBound < valueOut, "Price shift low detected");
require(upperBound > valueOut, "Price shift high detected");

Note that this function is extremely important as it is used to determine the total collateral value of an NFT in #Vault_Velo.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Chainlink USD oracle always having 8 decimal is wrong. We do not want to make this assumption. It depends on whether ETH is the first or second value in the pair.
