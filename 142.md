# increaseCollateralAmount() may be unable to prevent liquidation

## Summary

Vault_Velo#increaseCollateralAmount() forces "met liquidation margin" for each increase, and can only be increased NFT one by one, causing  be unable to prevent liquidation if I have two NFTs

## Vulnerability Detail

When my collateral falls below the liquidation threshold, I will add collateral to stop the liquidation by using #increaseCollateralAmount()
But in Vault_Velo#increaseCollateralAmount(), I can only add collateral one by one, and each of them needs to be greater than the liquidation value after increaseCollateralAmount(), which can cause me no way to increase collateral
Suppose : the current liquidation threshold is 600, and I have two NFTs, each worth 500.
At this point, I can only add the first one, but it doesn't work (revert("Liquidation margin not met!")), and adding the second one still doesn't work, and Vault_Velo.sol doesn't provide a way to add multiple NFTs at once
I have enough other assets to prevent being liquidated, but I can't add them, which I think is unreasonable
Suggest adding a parameter for the user to decide to skip detection "met liquidation margin"

```solidity
    function increaseCollateralAmount(
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _NFTId
        ) external whenNotPaused 
        {
...
        uint256 USDborrowed = (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice) / LOAN_SCALE;
        uint256 borrowMargin = (USDborrowed * liquidatableMargin) / LOAN_SCALE;
        require(existingCollateral + addedValue >= borrowMargin, "Liquidation margin not met!");
        //***@audit need  met Liquidation margin****/
...
```
## Impact
have enough other assets to prevent being liquidated, but  can't add them

## Recommendation

```solidity
    function increaseCollateralAmount(
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _NFTId,
+       bool skipMet
        ) external whenNotPaused 
        {
...

+      if (!skipMet){       
            uint256 USDborrowed = (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice) / LOAN_SCALE;
            uint256 borrowMargin = (USDborrowed * liquidatableMargin) / LOAN_SCALE;
            require(existingCollateral + addedValue >= borrowMargin, "Liquidation margin not met!");
+       }

```
