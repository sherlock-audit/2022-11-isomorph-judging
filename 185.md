# The admin of `RoleControl` can use `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to bypass the timelock

## Summary

In `RoleControl.sol`, only the admin can add a new role to an account. And that is a two step process with a time delay. However, the admin can add `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to an account. Then, the account can add roles to any account without a time delay.

## Vulnerability Detail

The admin of `RoleControl` can add a new role to an account by calling `proposeAddRole()` and `addRole()`. Itâ€™s a two step process with a reasonable time delay. But a malicious admin can add `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to an account he/she owns. Then, he/she can use that account to call `AccessControl.grantRole()` to immediately add roles.

## Impact

The two step process with a time delay can be easily bypassed. It could cause serious problems. For example, a malicious admin can add `MINTER_ROLE` to an account immediately. Then he/she can arbitrarily mint tokens. Since the admin should be trustworthy, we consider it a medium issue.
