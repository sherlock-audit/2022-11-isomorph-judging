# Theft of rewards in Depositor.sol

## Summary

An anonymous user can withdraw rewards of a depositor.

## Vulnerability Detail

`withdrawFromGauge` needs the NFT owner to approve the token to the depositor in order to withdraw rewards. But doing so allows a hacker to withdraw the rewards before the depositor does.

## Impact
