# User can lose the Depositor.sol NFT when calling withdrawFromGauge without fullying withdraw the token reward from the gauge

## Summary

User can lose the Depositor.sol NFT when calling withdrawFromGauge without fullying withdraw the pooledToken

## Vulnerability Detail

We can look into the function withdrawFromGauge:

```solidity
function withdrawFromGauge(uint256 _NFTId, address[] memory _tokens)  public  {
    uint256 amount = depositReceipt.pooledTokens(_NFTId);
    depositReceipt.burn(_NFTId);
    gauge.getReward(address(this), _tokens);
    gauge.withdraw(amount);
    //AMMToken adheres to ERC20 spec meaning it reverts on failure, no need to check return
    //slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
    AMMToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

first, user's NFT is burned.

```solidity
depositReceipt.burn(_NFTId);
```

then the code claims the reward from the gauge contract.

```solidity
gauge.getReward(address(this), _tokens);
```

and withdraw:

```solidity
gauge.withdraw(amount);
//AMMToken adheres to ERC20 spec meaning it reverts on failure, no need to check return
//slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
AMMToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
```

consider the case:

the gauge support two token, token A and token B,

but the user is calling withdrawFromGauge with only tokenA, 

NFT is burned, user is not able to claim token B reward forever.

## Impact

User can lose the Depositor.sol NFT when calling withdrawFromGauge without fullying withdraw the token reward from the gauge

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If we look into the Gauge.sol

https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/master/contracts/Gauge.sol

We can see that a list of supported token for reward is set in the constructor:

https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/de6b2a19b5174013112ad41f07cf98352bfe1f24/contracts/Gauge.sol#L95

```solidity
for (uint i; i < _allowedRewardTokens.length; i++) {
    if (_allowedRewardTokens[i] != address(0)) {
        isReward[_allowedRewardTokens[i]] = true;
        rewards.push(_allowedRewardTokens[i]);
    }
}
```

and we can query a list of the support reward token by checking

https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/de6b2a19b5174013112ad41f07cf98352bfe1f24/contracts/Gauge.sol#L44

```solidity
address[] public rewards;
```

We recommend the project check the a list of reward token from the gauge contract and claim reward when user withdrawFromGauge, because burning NFT is not a reversible action.

```solidity
function withdrawFromGauge(uint256 _NFTId)  public  {
    uint256 amount = depositReceipt.pooledTokens(_NFTId);
    depositReceipt.burn(_NFTId);
    address[] memory _tokens = gauge.rewards(); // here
    gauge.getReward(address(this), _tokens);
    gauge.withdraw(amount);
    //AMMToken adheres to ERC20 spec meaning it reverts on failure, no need to check return
    //slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
    AMMToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
