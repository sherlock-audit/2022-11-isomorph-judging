# `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` contains a wrong number.

## Summary
`CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` contains a wrong number.

## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see by the comment next to it, `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` is supposed to be 2 days. 
But as how it is right now the delay will be only 200 seconds. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L23

As a result the require statement in the function `changeCollateralType()` can be bypassed after 200 seconds instead of 2 days.

## Impact
This issue breaks the logic, as the "time delays" are important to the protocol.
And leads to bypassing a certain require statement in a function in a short period of time than it's supposed to be.

## Recommendation
Change to - `uint256 public constant CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY = 2 days;`
