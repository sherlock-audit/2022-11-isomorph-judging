# Insufficient check in `getOraclePrice()` can return incorrect data

## Summary
`getOraclePrice()` is not checking `answeredInRound` value. The data returned can be incorrect due to an incomplete round.

## Vulnerability Detail
`answeredInRound` returns the round ID of the round in which the answer was computed. We should verify that `answeredInRound >= roundId` to ensure that the data we are seeing is fresh.

## Impact
Incorrect price returned by oracle can be very damaging to the protocol.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the check `require(answeredInRound >= roundId)` in`getOraclePrice()`.
