# Current algorithm of closing loan is not correct

## Summary
The current algorithm of closing loan is not correct, will cause part of users cannot exit the system and make the isoUSD value higher than $1 USD target.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current implementation of ````closeLoan()```` burns principle before transferring interest to treasure, this will cause the total supply of isoUSD not enough to cover total demand (total principle + total interest).

__To illustrate with an example:__
Let's say there is  an initial user A
```solidity
loanOfA = 1000 isoUSD
balanceOfTreasure = openFee = 10 isoUSD
balanceOfA = 990 isoUSD
supply = 1000 isoUSD
```
Time flies, and
```solidity
interest = 100 isoUSD
```
Now, the user want to close the loan, and buy all iosUSD from market
```solidity
maxPayable = supply = 1000 isoUSD =  principle = burned
```
The user still owes 100 isoUSD, but there is no supply existing.

How to do?
Another user B comes in, and
```solidity
loanOfB = 1000 isoUSD
balanceOfTreasure = openFee = 10 isoUSD
balanceOfB = 990 isoUSD
supply = 1000 isoUSD
```
B sell 100 isoUSD to A with some profit like 1.01 $USD per isoUSD.
A pays left 100 isoUSD debt, then
```solidity
loanOfB = 1000 isoUSD
balanceOfTreasure = 10 + 100 = 110 isoUSD
balanceOfB = 890 isoUSD
supply = 1000 isoUSD
```

Things work?
No, when B tries to close loan, he will encounter the same problem as A, have to seek help from Cï¼Œso the problem is just transferred but not solved.

While we expand it to realistic scenarios, both A, B and C are a group of users, that is the last part of users cannot exit the system due to lack of enough isoUSD supply.

And as the supply is less than demand, the market price will be higher than expected $1 USD per isoUSD.

## Impact
<1>Part of users cannot exit the system
<2>make the isoUSD value higher than $1 USD target

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function closeLoan(
    address _collateralAddress,
    uint256 _collateralToUser,
    uint256 _USDToVault
    ) external override whenNotPaused 
{
    
    // ...
    uint256 interestPaid;
    uint256 loanPrinciple = isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender];
    if( loanPrinciple >= _USDToVault){
        // @audit pay off loan principle first, and this part will be burned
        isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = loanPrinciple - _USDToVault;
    }
    else{
        interestPaid = _USDToVault - loanPrinciple;
        isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = 0;
    }
    // ...

    _decreaseLoan(_collateralAddress, _collateralToUser, _USDToVault, interestPaid);
}

function _decreaseLoan(address _collateralAddress, uint256 _amount,uint256 _USDReturned,
                        uint256 _interestPaid) internal {
    IERC20 collateral = IERC20(_collateralAddress);

    uint256 USDBurning = _USDReturned - _interestPaid;

    isoUSD.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _USDReturned);

    isoUSD.burn(address(this), USDBurning); // @audit principle burned firstly

    isoUSD.transfer(treasury, _interestPaid);
    bool success  = collateral.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    require(success);
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pay interest before burning principle to ensure there is enough supply to pay all interest.
