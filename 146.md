# Using wrong variable in increaseCollateralAmount() function.

## Summary

The ```increaseCollateralAmount()``` function uses the ```liquidatableMargin``` variable instead of ```minOpeningMargin```.


## Vulnerability Detail

The ```openLoan()```, ```increaseCollateralAmount()```, ```closeLoan()``` and ```callLiquidation()``` functions calculate the necessary margin for the borrowing/liquidation.

The ```increaseCollateralAmount()``` function uses the ```liquidatableMargin``` variable instead of ```minOpeningMargin```. As the comment [says](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L39) for the minOpeningMargin variable: "minimum loan margin required on opening or adjusting a loan". The increaseCollateralAmount is adjusting the loan because it allows the user not to be liquidated.

## Impact

The margin required in the ```increaseCollateralAmount()``` function is different from the ```openLoan()``` function. 

The user can **increase their collateral without any borrow amount** with the openLoan function (the user needs to put collateral and put zero in the [_USDBorrowed](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L385) variable), so the user can intentionally use different required margin between ```openLoan()``` and ```increaseCollateralAmount()``` in order to add collateral in the protocol.

```solidity
uint256 borrowMargin = (USDborrowed * liquidatableMargin) / LOAN_SCALE;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use ```minOpeningMargin``` variable instead in the ```increaseCollateralAmount()``` function.
