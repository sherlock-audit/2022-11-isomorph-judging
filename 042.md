# Vault_Lyra will continue calculate interests when contract collateral asset is paused

## Summary
Vault_Lyra will continue calculate interests when contract collateral asset is paused
## Vulnerability Detail
If collateral asset will be paused in CollateralBook that means that no one will be able to call closeLoan function and close his loan, because of collateral [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L211).
That would be fine if no interests were accrued in that period. But interests accruing is not stopping.

So when the collateral asset will be unpaused and users will be allowed to close their loans they might pay more interests that they were expected.

Example.
1.User wants to close his loan were 100$ of interests are accrued at the moment.
2.Owner pauses collateral asset that user used for loan in CollateralBook.
3.User couldn't close loan and should wait.
4.After some long time collateral asset is unpaused and now user have 150$ of interests that he should pay.
5.As a result user lost 50$.
