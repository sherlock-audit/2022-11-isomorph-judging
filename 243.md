# The price calculation mechanism of `priceLiquidity()` will allow users taking pooltokens of low liquidity to borrow isoUSD that has higher liquidity, which creates bad debts

## Summary
The price calculation mechanism of `priceLiquidity()` will allow users taking pooltokens of low liquidity to borrow isoUSD that has higher liquidity, which creates bad debts that users can exchange isoUSD to token of high liqudity, like USDC, and never pay back.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using case `token0 == USDC` in `priceLiquidity()` of contract `DepositReceipt_USDC` for example, as shown in the following codes, `value1 = (token1Amount * oraclePrice) / oracleBase` is calculated by multiplying `token1Amount` with oracle price, where `token1Amount` is obtained by removal of liquidity. When pooltokens of pair `token1` and `USDC` has low liquidity, the exchange router may get the amount `token1Amount'` far less than `token1Amount` calculated by removal of liquidity (`token1Amount'<token1Amount`), and the liquidity is priced higher than it actually has in current implementation. In this situation, users can borrow more isoUSD that has higher liquidity than pooltokens, exchange isoUSD to token of high liqudity, like USDC, and never come back to close loan or call liqudiation.

```solidity
    function priceLiquidity(uint256 _liquidity) external override view returns(uint256){
        uint256 token0Amount;
        uint256 token1Amount;
        (token0Amount, token1Amount) = viewQuoteRemoveLiquidity(_liquidity);
        uint256 value0;
        uint256 value1;
        if (token0 == USDC){
            uint256 amountOut;
            bool stablePool; 
            (amountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(HUNDRED_TOKENS, token1, USDC);
            require(stablePool == stable, "pricing occuring through wrong pool" );

            uint256 oraclePrice = getOraclePrice(priceFeed, tokenMaxPrice, tokenMinPrice);
            amountOut = (amountOut * oracleBase) / USDC_BASE / HUNDRED; 

            uint256 lowerBound = (oraclePrice * (BASE - ALLOWED_DEVIATION)) / BASE;
            uint256 upperBound = (oraclePrice * (BASE + ALLOWED_DEVIATION)) / BASE;
            require(lowerBound < amountOut, "Price shift low detected");
            require(upperBound > amountOut, "Price shift high detected");

            value0 = token0Amount * SCALE_SHIFT; 
            value1 = (token1Amount * oraclePrice) / oracleBase;
        } else {  //token1 must be USDC 
            ...
        }
        return(value0 + value1);
    }
```

## Impact
Allow users to exchange pooltokens of low liquidity to tokens that has high liquidity, which create bad debts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Using the amountOut calculated by exchange router, like change the above codes to:
```diff
    function priceLiquidity(uint256 _liquidity) external override view returns(uint256){
        uint256 token0Amount;
        uint256 token1Amount;
        (token0Amount, token1Amount) = viewQuoteRemoveLiquidity(_liquidity);
        uint256 value0;
        uint256 value1;
        if (token0 == USDC){
            uint256 amountOut;
            bool stablePool; 
            (amountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(HUNDRED_TOKENS, token1, USDC);
            require(stablePool == stable, "pricing occuring through wrong pool" );

            uint256 oraclePrice = getOraclePrice(priceFeed, tokenMaxPrice, tokenMinPrice);
            amountOut = (amountOut * oracleBase) / USDC_BASE / HUNDRED; 

            uint256 lowerBound = (oraclePrice * (BASE - ALLOWED_DEVIATION)) / BASE;
            uint256 upperBound = (oraclePrice * (BASE + ALLOWED_DEVIATION)) / BASE;
            require(lowerBound < amountOut, "Price shift low detected");
            require(upperBound > amountOut, "Price shift high detected");

            value0 = token0Amount * SCALE_SHIFT; 
-           value1 = (token1Amount * oraclePrice) / oracleBase;
+           (USDCAmountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(token1Amount, token1, USDC);
+           value1 = USDCAmountOut * SCALE_SHIFT;
        } else {  //token1 must be USDC 
            ...
        }
        return(value0 + value1);
    }
```
