# Depositor contract owner can claim rewards even if he doesn't own the deposit receipts.

## Summary

The Depositor contract owner can create deposit receipts with the [depositToGauge()](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/blob/1e9234236a8ff708d67343bc54f93af5bb584e06/contracts/Depositor.sol#L58) function, then put them in the Vault Velo as a collateral and still claim rewards from the Velodrome Gauge.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Depositor contract owner can use their deposit receipts in different ways:

- As a collateral in the Vaul Velo.
- The deposit receipts can be transferred to the liquidator if the Depositor owner gets liquidated.
- Transfer the deposit receipts to another user.

In those situations, the Depositor owner does not have the deposit receipts and he can still claim the rewards.

## Impact

The Depositor contract owner can still claim rewards of deposit receipts he doesn't own. There could be situations where are not fair for the deposit receipts owners:

- The collateral (deposit receipts) deposited in the Vault Velo could be for one year in the protocol without getting rewards to the protocol.
- The deposit receipts transferred to the liquidators are not eligible to get rewards for the new owner. The liquidator can decide not to withdraw the tokens from the Gague, allowing the Depositor Contract Owner get more rewards.

[claimRewards()](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/blob/1e9234236a8ff708d67343bc54f93af5bb584e06/contracts/Depositor.sol)

```solidity
function claimRewards( address[] memory _tokens) onlyOwner() external {
    require(_tokens.length > 0, "Empty tokens array");
    gauge.getReward(address(this), _tokens);
    
    uint256 length =  _tokens.length;
    for (uint i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(_tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
        // using SafeERC20 in case reward token returns false on failure
        IERC20(_tokens[i]).safeTransfer(msg.sender, balance);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider give the rewards to the receipt owners instead the Depositor contract owner.

It's fairer for the receipts owners to get the rewards instead of the Depositor contract Owner, also owning those deposit receipts can incentivize the liquidators/protocol to claim the rewards. 

So it is possible to accumulate the rewards in the Depositor contract until the receipt owner withdraw ([withdrawFromGauge()](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/blob/1e9234236a8ff708d67343bc54f93af5bb584e06/contracts/Depositor.sol#L119)) the tokens related to the deposit receipt. This [transfer](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/blob/1e9234236a8ff708d67343bc54f93af5bb584e06/contracts/Depositor.sol#L144) could be removed and added in the ```withdrawFromGauge()``` function.
