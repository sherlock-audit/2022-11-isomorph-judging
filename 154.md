# Function never used

## Summary
Function `addVaultAddress()` is never used
## Vulnerability Detail
The following method is never used. Most importantly there is no way of setting `vaults[_assetType]` to an address, despite the fact that it is stated to be set once on  construction
## Impact
The protocol does not have a mechanism to set a `vault` for an `assetType`
