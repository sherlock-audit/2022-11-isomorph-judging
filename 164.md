# EIP-4844 and other future updates may make it possible to game $0.001 loan forgiveness

## Summary

EIP-4844 may allow gaming loan forgiveness to make a profit

## Vulnerability Detail

    if(outstandingisoUSD >= TENTH_OF_CENT){ //ignore leftover debts less than $0.001
        uint256 collateralLeft = collateralPosted[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] - _collateralToUser;
        uint256 colInUSD = priceCollateralToUSD(currencyKey, collateralLeft); 
        uint256 borrowMargin = (outstandingisoUSD * minOpeningMargin) / LOAN_SCALE;
        require(colInUSD > borrowMargin , "Remaining debt fails to meet minimum margin!");
    }

If the remaining debt after paying back a loan is less than $0.001 the user is allowed to remove all of their collateral. Currently a single transaction is estimated to cost $0.10, which is well above that threshold. EIP-4844 is estimated to lower fees on Optimism by 10-100x. Combined with batching, gas golfing and periods of low L1/L2 usage, it may become possible to game the $0.001 loan forgiveness to make a profit.

The flow of transactions from the user would be first to borrow 0.001 isoUSD, repay 0 isoUSD (to recover all their collateral) then liquidate themselves to clear their bad debt. Creating a contract that batches calls, uses only constants and requires no transaction inputs would allow the attacker to significantly lower their transaction cost, combined with EIP-4844 and low L1 gas fees could allow the attack to be profitable. 

This wouldn't be possible on the Synths vault due to the 100 isoUSD minimum but could be done on either of the other vaults.

## Impact

Loan forgiveness may be gamed to make a profit

## Recommendation

I recommend removing the $0.001 for a few reason:
1. Interest updates in discrete 3 minute intervals so it would be fairly easy to predict via the front end
2. Assuming a request to pay completely close out a loan is made and a 3 minute interval roll over before the transaction is processed, $0.001 will only prevent the transaction from reverting if the loan amount is less than $3703 (assuming 5% APR).
3. TENTH_OF_CENT is a constant so it can't be changed after being set, which means changes in fees overtime may make it profitable to game

Instead of forgiving the debt, allow the user to dynamically pay off their entire balance by specifying more than they owe. This requires a few other small changes to the contract, like making _closeLoanChecks after adjusting _USDToVault and comparing outstanding balance to 0 rather than TENTH_OF_CENT:

        _collateralExists(_collateralAddress);
    -   _closeLoanChecks(_collateralAddress, _collateralToUser, _USDToVault);
        //make sure virtual price is related to current time before fetching collateral details
        //slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-vulnerabilities-1
        _updateVirtualPrice(block.timestamp, _collateralAddress);
        (   
            bytes32 currencyKey,
            uint256 minOpeningMargin,
            ,
            ,
            ,
            uint256 virtualPrice,
            
        ) = _getCollateral(_collateralAddress);
        //check for frozen or paused collateral
        _checkIfCollateralIsActive(currencyKey);
        uint256 isoUSDdebt = (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice) / LOAN_SCALE;

    -   require( isoUSDdebt >= _USDToVault, "Trying to return more isoUSD than borrowed!");
    -   uint256 outstandingisoUSD = isoUSDdebt - _USDToVault;
    - 
    +   uint256 outstandingisoUSD

    +   //Allow user to pay off entire debt by specifying more than they owe
    +   if(isoUSDdebt <= _USDToVault) {
    +       _USDToVault = isoUSDdebt;
    +   } else {
    +       outstandingisoUSD = isoUSDdebt - _USDToVault;
    +   }

    +   //Check if user has enough isoUSD to pay off loan after adjustment
    +   _closeLoanChecks(_collateralAddress, _collateralToUser, _USDToVault);

    -  if(outstandingisoUSD >= TENTH_OF_CENT){ //ignore leftover debts less than $0.001
    +  //No need to check collateral if loan is fully paid off
    +  if(outstandingisoUSD >= 0) {
            uint256 collateralLeft = collateralPosted[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] - _collateralToUser;
            uint256 colInUSD = priceCollateralToUSD(currencyKey, collateralLeft); 
            uint256 borrowMargin = (outstandingisoUSD * minOpeningMargin) / LOAN_SCALE;
            require(colInUSD > borrowMargin , "Remaining debt fails to meet minimum margin!");
        }
