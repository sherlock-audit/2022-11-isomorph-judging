# Possible to call CollateralBook.changeCollateralType for collateral asset after it was paused

## Summary
Possible to call CollateralBook.changeCollateralType for collateral asset after it was paused
## Vulnerability Detail
CollateralBook.changeCollateralType function is used to update collateral asset parameters. It should be used after queueCollateralChange function was called and delay time has passed.

queueCollateralChange function should never be called when collateral asset is paused as it uses collateralExists [modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L104).
The same behaviour should be set for changeCollateralType function. But it doesn't have collateralExists modifier.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L127-L158
```solidity
    function changeCollateralType() external onlyAdmin {
        uint256 submissionTimestamp = queuedTimestamp;
        require(submissionTimestamp != 0, "Uninitialized collateral change");
        require(submissionTimestamp + CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY <= block.timestamp, "Not enough time passed");
        address collateralAddress = queuedCollateralAddress;
        bytes32 currencyKey = queuedCurrencyKey;
        uint256 minimumRatio = queuedMinimumRatio;
        uint256 liquidationRatio = queuedLiquidationRatio;
        uint256 interestPer3Min = queuedInterestPer3Min;
        address liquidityPool = queuedLiquidityPool;
        


        //Now we must ensure interestPer3Min changes aren't applied retroactively
        // by updating the assets virtualPrice to current block timestamp
        uint256 timeDelta = (block.timestamp - collateralProps[collateralAddress].lastUpdateTime) / THREE_MIN;
        if (timeDelta != 0){ 
           updateVirtualPriceSlowly(collateralAddress, timeDelta );
        }
        bytes32 oldCurrencyKey = collateralProps[collateralAddress].currencyKey;


        _changeCollateralParameters(
            collateralAddress,
            currencyKey,
            minimumRatio,
            liquidationRatio,
            interestPer3Min
        );
        //Then update LiqPool as this isn't stored in the struct and requires the currencyKey also.
        liquidityPoolOf[oldCurrencyKey]= address(0); 
        liquidityPoolOf[currencyKey]= liquidityPool;
        
    }
```
In case if some time has passed since last collateral virtual price update then this function will call updateVirtualPriceSlowly function which also use collateralExists modifier and will revert if collateral is paused. 
```solidity
        uint256 timeDelta = (block.timestamp - collateralProps[collateralAddress].lastUpdateTime) / THREE_MIN;
        if (timeDelta != 0){ 
           updateVirtualPriceSlowly(collateralAddress, timeDelta );
        }
```

But if less then 3 minutes have passed since last virtual price updated and collateral was paused then it is possible to run changeCollateralType function successfully as updateVirtualPriceSlowly function will not be called.

Scenario.
1.Admin calls queueCollateralChange function with new parameters for collateral.
2.Collateral virtual price is updated.
3.Then almost in same time admin pauses collateral.
4.Admins calls changeCollateralType before 3 minutes has passed since virtual price update.
5.Params are changed on paused collateral.
## Impact
Admin have ability to change collateral params when it is paused.

## Recommendation
Add collateralExists modifier to the changeCollateralType function.
