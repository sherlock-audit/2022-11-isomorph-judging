# Vault_Velo will stop working with collateral if oracle in DepositReceipt_USDC or DepositReceipt_ETH will stop working

## Summary
Vault_Velo will stop working with collateral if oracle in DepositReceipt_USDC or DepositReceipt_ETH will stop working
## Vulnerability Detail
DepositReceipt_USDC and DepositReceipt_ETH contracts depend on oracle to get their deposited amount prices.
They use chain link oracles which are provided during contract creation.
In case if smth will happen with any oracle and it will nor be working anymore then DepositReceipt_USDC and DepositReceipt_ETH contracts do not have ability to set new oracle. 
And as a result Vault_Velo will stop working with that collateral and no one will be able to close their loan, because Vault_Velo will be reverting when it tries to [calculate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L555) deposited nft amount, because DepositReceipt_Base.getOraclePrice will be always reverting.
## Impact
No one will be able to close their loan and will lose collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add ability to change oracle address for both contracts.
