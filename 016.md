# Continuous charging of opening fee even when extending a loan

## Summary
The `openLoan` function is used to both open a loan and increase an existing loan. The function charges a fee on all passed amounts and as such whether a user is opening a loan or increasing a loan, they will always be charged opening fee. 
## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of the function, the internal `increaseLoan ()` function is called as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L142. `increaseLoan ()` function charges a fee on all amount passed as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L229-L239. Moreover, from the fee calculation, if the amount passed is too small and does not accommodate the fee charged, it will revert. 
## Impact
Users will always be charged opening fee even when they are extending a loan.
