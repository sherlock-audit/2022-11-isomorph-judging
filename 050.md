# The rewards can be stuck in the **depositor** contract

## Summary

The function `getReward` call to **gauge** could be revert => the `claimRewards`/`withdrawFromGauge` reverts and the funds would be stuck in the **depositor** contract

## Vulnerability Detail

The functions `claimRewards` and `withdrawFromGauge` use the **gauge** function `getReward`, this functions could revert 
If in the `claimRewards` the `gauge.getReward` reverts regardless of the `_tokens` parameter, the tokens of the **gauge** could not be withdrawn and the deposited `AMMToken` tokens would be stuck
If in the `withdrawFromGauge` reverts with depending of the `_tokens` parameter, only the tokens who make the revert would be stuck in the **depositor** contract 

## Impact

In the case of the function `claimRewards` could not be withdrawn the tokens of the **gauge** and this `AMMToken` tokens would be stuck in the **gauge** contract
And in the function `withdrawFromGauge` the rewards and all tokens who haves the **depositor** contract would be stuck in this contract

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a withdraw function and skip the `gauge.getReward` if the `_tokens` parameter it's empty:
