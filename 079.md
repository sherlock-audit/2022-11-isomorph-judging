# _interestPer3Min can be set wrongly, causing virtualPrice to be incorrect which will always cause a revert.

## Summary
In `_updateVirtualPrice`, interestPer3Min is expected to be inclusive of the base 100% rather than standalone. So if interest is 1%, interestPer3Min should be 101%. This ambiguity can cause interestPer3Min to be set wrongly, potentially overriding virtualPrice to the interest only and causing a revert always due to `   require( collateralProps[_collateralAddress].virtualPrice < _virtualPriceUpdate, "Incorrect virtual price" );`.


## Vulnerability Detail
In `_updateVirtualPrice` in `Vault_Velo`, interestPer3Min is taken from getCollateral.   `virtualPrice = (virtualPrice * interestPer3Min) / LOAN_SCALE;`, as you can see, the interest calculated is not added to virtualPrice, but instead overriden. If interestPer3Min is set to > 100%, that will be working as intended. However, this is misleading as at first thought, you will think that interestPer3Min is how many percentage to increment the base amount, rather than being inclusive of the base amount. 

```solidity
    function _updateVirtualPrice(uint256 _currentBlockTime, address _collateralAddress) internal { 
        (   ,
            ,
            ,
            uint256 interestPer3Min,
            uint256 lastUpdateTime,
            uint256 virtualPrice
        ) = _getCollateral(_collateralAddress);
        uint256 timeDelta = _currentBlockTime - lastUpdateTime;
        //exit gracefully if two users call the function for the same collateral in the same block 
        uint256 threeMinuteDelta = timeDelta / 180; 
        if(threeMinuteDelta > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < threeMinuteDelta; i++ ){
            virtualPrice = (virtualPrice * interestPer3Min) / LOAN_SCALE;
            }
            collateralBook.vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, virtualPrice, _currentBlockTime);
        }
    }

```

As you can see when setting the interestPer3Min, there is no checks to _interestPer3Min. _interestPer3Min can be > 100% or < 100%. A check can be done to make sure _interestPer3Min is > 100%.

```solidity
    function addCollateralType(
        address _collateralAddress,
        bytes32 _currencyKey,
        uint256 _minimumRatio,
        uint256 _liquidationRatio,
        uint256 _interestPer3Min,
        uint256 _assetType,
        address _liquidityPool
        ) external onlyAdmin {

        require(!collateralValid[_collateralAddress], "Collateral already exists");
        require(!collateralPaused[_collateralAddress], "Collateral already exists");
        require(_collateralAddress != address(0));
        require(_minimumRatio > _liquidationRatio);
        require(_liquidationRatio > 0);
        require(vaults[_assetType] != address(0), "Vault not deployed yet");
        IVault vault = IVault(vaults[_assetType]);

        //prevent setting liquidationRatio too low such that it would cause an overflow in callLiquidation, see appendix on liquidation maths for details.
        require( vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio >= 10 ** 36, "Liquidation ratio too low"); //i.e. 1 when multiplying two 1 ether scale numbers.
        collateralValid[_collateralAddress] = true;
        collateralProps[_collateralAddress] = Collateral(
            _currencyKey,
            _minimumRatio,
            _liquidationRatio,
            _interestPer3Min,
            block.timestamp,
            1 ether,
            _assetType
            );
        //Then update LiqPool as this isn't stored in the struct and requires the currencyKey also.
        liquidityPoolOf[_currencyKey]= _liquidityPool; 
    }
```


## Impact
_interestPer3Min can easily be set wrongly , causing the whole protocol to revert with the virtualPrice set to interest only.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

we can just restrict interestPer3Min in `addCollatoralType` and `queueCollateralChange` to be > 100%.
