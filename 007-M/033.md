# Vault_Base_ERC20 will revert when working with ERC20 tokens that doesn't return bool on transfer function

## Summary
Vault_Base_ERC20 will revert when working with ERC20 tokens that doesn't return bool on transfer function.
## Vulnerability Detail
Vault_Base_ERC20._decreaseLoan function is working with ERC20 tooken like this `bool success  = collateral.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);`. However it's possible that the token is not returning bool value. In such case the function will revert.
As result protocol can't work normally with erc20 tokens that doesn't return bool value on transfer function.
## Impact
Protocol can't work normally with erc20 tokens that doesn't return bool value on transfer function.
