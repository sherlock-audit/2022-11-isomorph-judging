# Parameters of paused collateral tokens can't be changed.

## Summary
Parameters of paused collateral tokens can't be changed.

## Vulnerability Detail
As how it is now the function `queueCollateralChange()` can't be called on paused collateral, duo to the modifier collateralExists.
This can be a problem if the following scenario occurs:

Admin calls the function `addCollateralType()` and successfully adds a new collateral token.  Later by checking the mapping collateralProps, he notices a mistake he made in the collateral parameters. The admin doesn't want anyone to open a loan with the wrong parameters of the collateral, so he calls the function `pauseCollateralType()` and pauses the collateral.

Admin can't call the function `queueCollateralChange()`, duo to the modifier `collateralExists` as it check if the collateral exists.
This is potentially a problem because the same collateral address can't be added again, collateral can't be changed duo to the modifier on the function `queueCollateralChange()` and neither the admin wants to unpause the collateral as someone can open a loan with the wrong parameters of the collateral.

## Impact
Duo to the issue described in "Vulnerability Detail", parameters of paused collateral tokens can't be changed if necessary.
As the function `queueCollateralChange()` reverts, because of the modifier collateralExists.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider creating a new modifier which will be applied on the functions `queueCollateralChange()` and `updateVirtualPriceSlowly()` and can be called by paused collateral as well. https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/7820aa470ada9bdc57dafdc466a08de6

// Note having the modifier on updateVirtualPriceSlowly() has another plus, which is that the virtual price of temporary paused collateral tokens can be updated as well, so it won't lead to DOS.
