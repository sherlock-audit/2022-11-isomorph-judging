# Parameters of paused collateral tokens can't be changed.

## Summary
Parameters of paused collateral tokens can't be changed.

## Vulnerability Detail
As how it is now the function `queueCollateralChange()` can't be called on paused collateral, duo to the modifier collateralExists.
This can be a problem if the following scenario occurs:

Admin calls the function `addCollateralType()` and successfully adds a new collateral token.  Later by checking the mapping collateralProps, he notices a mistake he made in the collateral parameters. The admin doesn't want anyone to open a loan with the wrong parameters of the collateral, so he calls the function `pauseCollateralType()` and pauses the collateral.

Admin can't call the function `queueCollateralChange()`, duo to the modifier `collateralExists` as it check if the collateral exists.
This is potentially a problem because the same collateral address can't be added again, collateral can't be changed duo to the modifier on the function `queueCollateralChange()` and neither the admin wants to unpause the collateral as someone can open a loan with the wrong parameters of the collateral.

## Impact
Duo to the issue described in "Vulnerability Detail", parameters of paused collateral tokens can't be changed if necessary.
As the function `queueCollateralChange()` reverts, because of the modifier collateralExists.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider creating a new modifier which will be applied on the functions `queueCollateralChange()` and `updateVirtualPriceSlowly()` and can be called by paused collateral as well. https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/7820aa470ada9bdc57dafdc466a08de6

// Note having the modifier on `updateVirtualPriceSlowly()` has another plus, which is that the virtual price of temporary paused collateral tokens can be updated as well, so it won't lead to DOS.
