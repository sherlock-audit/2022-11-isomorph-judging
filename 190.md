# Vault doesn't handle fee-on-transfer/deflationary collaterals

## Summary

Vault doesn't handle fee-on-transfer/deflationary collaterals/tokens. Though the protocol can use `_collateralExists` to set supported collaterals, we can't guarantee that the allowed non-deflationary token will always not become a deflationary token.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume that A token is a deflationary token, and it will take 10% fees when transferring tokens.
The vault records values by using `_colAmount`. If a user calls `openLoan` and sets `_collateralAddress = A token, _colAmount = 100` on Vault_Synths or Vault_Lyra, the user will send 100 tokens to the vault but the vault only received 90 tokens.

## Impact

The vault records that the increased collateral is 100 tokens, but the vault only received 90 tokens. The vault doesn't have enough tokens when the user calls closeLoan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `balanceAfter - balanceBefore`:

```solidity
    uint256 balanceBefore = deflationaryToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    deflationaryToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = deflationaryToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    actualAmount = (balanceAfter - balanceBefore);
```
