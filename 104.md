# Vault_Base_ERC20: Does not support fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
The Isomorph Vault contracts do not support fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Isomorph Vault contracts assume that when an amount x of tokens is transferred, the amount that is received by the receiver is the same amount x.
This is not true for some tokens.
E.g. tokens that implement a fee when they are transferred.

Therefore it is wrongly assumed that an amount x is added as collateral when the actual collateral received is less.

## Impact
There seems to be no issue for the collaterals that are currently used.
However new collaterals can be added in the future that break the current Vault implementation.
Therefore it is safer to make changes to the code such that fee-on-transfer tokens are supported.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The amount of tokens received should be calculated as the difference in token balance before and after the transfer. This adjusted amount should be used to make calculations regarding the collateral value.
