# `priceFeed` with 0 decimals breaks usage

# `priceFeed` with 0 decimals breaks usage
## Summary
In constructor, `priceFeed` is used without checking for decimals value being different than 0.

0 address is not being checked, this would have 0 decimals. Then, it's used for assigning value to `oracleBase`, immutable value that in this case, would be 0

## Vulnerability Detail
No checks for `oracleBase` being different than 0 would lead into `priceLiquidity` not being usable as it multiplies by `oracleBase` (getting 0) and also divides by `oracleBase` (division by 0 reverts)

## Impact
`priceLiquidity` reverting always

Same behavior in DepositReceipt_ETH when assigning `oracleBase` value using other decimals making same named function not to work as final return value divides by `oracleBase`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for not using decimals not being 0 and for `priceLiquidity` not being 0
