# Inconsistency in check of collateral > borrowMargin in `openLoan()` and `closeLoan()`

## Summary
`openLoan()` allows borrower to open a loan as long as remaining collateral is **greater or equal to** `borrowMargin`. However, when closing a loan, it requires remaining collateral to be **strictly greater than** `borrowMargin`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`openLoan()` in all 3 of the vaults checks for `require(colInUSD >= borrowMargin, "Minimum margin not met!")`. However, `closeLoan()` in all 3 of the vaults does the check `require(colInUSD > borrowMargin , "Remaining debt fails to meet minimum margin!")`. I would also want to point out that `increaseCollateralAmount` has the same `require` statement as `openLoan()`, so I believe this is an oversight.

## Impact
A user that opens a loan and then tries to close it for the same amount, assuming no change in any market conditions can fail the `closeLoan()` transaction due to this difference in margin requirement. A user that tries to close a part of its loan, while leaving the remaining collateral just enough for `borrowMargin()` will also not be able to do so.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the `require(colInUSD > borrowMargin , "Remaining debt fails to meet minimum margin!")` statement in `closeLoan()` to
`require(colInUSD >= borrowMargin , "Remaining debt fails to meet minimum margin!")`
