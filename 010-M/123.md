# DOS when no action happen for long enough time

## Vulnerability Detail

In these functions, they both used loops to calculate new virtual price. Number of iterations for these loops equal to number of 3-minutes block since last update time. If there is long enough time where no action happen (no update virtual price), it could cause DOS because of out of block gas limit. 

## Impact

Vault is DOS, cannot openLoan or closeLoan or do any action.

## Code Snippet

Function `_updateVirtualPrice()` used loop to calculate new virtual price
```solidity
if(threeMinuteDelta > 0) {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < threeMinuteDelta; i++ ){
    virtualPrice = (virtualPrice * interestPer3Min) / LOAN_SCALE; 
    }
    collateralBook.vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, virtualPrice, _currentBlockTime);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider hardcode some value like `interestPerDay` or  `interestPerWeek` and use them when time delta became too large.
Or if you are confident that you have great dev team, just write a bot that will call to update virtual price daily
