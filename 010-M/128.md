# Unbounded loop when updating the virtual price in Vault

## Summary

The _updateVirtualPrice() function in the provided Solidity code contains an unbounded loop, which can potentially consume all the gas and cause the function to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

The _updateVirtualPrice() function is intended to update the virtual price of a given collateral. It contains a for loop that updates the virtual price for each three-minute interval that has passed since the last update. However, the loop does not have any bounds checking, so it can potentially run for an unbounded number of iterations. This can consume all the gas available, causing the function to fail.

The number of the iteration per loop increases every three minutes. If the virtual price is not updated for an hour, it is 20 iteration, then the iteration increase by 20 * 24 = 480 per day.

## Impact

If the _updateVirtualPrice() function fails due to a lack of gas, it can lead to incorrect virtual prices for the collateral, potentially resulting in financial losses and confusion and revert the transaction when open loan, increase collateral and close loan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that the _updateVirtualPrice() function be modified to include bounds checking on the for loop. This will prevent the loop from consuming all the gas and causing the function to fail. This can be achieved by adding a maximum limit on the number of iterations that the loop can run, based on the maximum gas available or the maximum allowed time interval. This will ensure that the loop runs within the bounds of the available resources and does not cause the function to fail.
