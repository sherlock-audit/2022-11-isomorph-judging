# The virtual price of collateral is less than it should be.



## Summary
The virtual price of collateral is less than expected due to error on updating `lastUpdateTime`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In vault contracts, the virtual price of a collateral is updated using current timestamp before it is used.

```solidity
_updateVirtualPrice(block.timestamp, _collateralAddress); 
```
There are 3 vault contracts, and the implementation of `_updateVirtualPrice` is in `Vault_Base_ERC20` for `Vault_Lyra` and `Vault_Synths`, and in the same contract for `Vault_Velo`.
Those two implementations are almost same and have defects when the timestamp is updated.

```solidity
        uint256 timeDelta = _currentBlockTime - lastUpdateTime;
        //exit gracefully if two users call the function for the same collateral in the same block 
        uint256 threeMinuteDelta = timeDelta / 180; 
        if(threeMinuteDelta > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < threeMinuteDelta; i++ ){
            virtualPrice = (virtualPrice * interestPer3Min) / LOAN_SCALE; 
            }
            collateralBook.vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, virtualPrice, _currentBlockTime); //@audit wrong timestamp
        }
```

They call `collateralBook.vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime` with `block.timestamp`, so `lastUpdateTime` will be set by current timestamp when we update the virtual price.

```solidity
        collateralProps[_collateralAddress].lastUpdateTime = _updateTime;
```

If `timeDelta` is 359(=5m 59s), `lastUpdateTime` is increased by 359 instead of 180.
If users interact every 359s, `virtualPrice` is interested only once for 359 seconds although it should be interested nearly twice during the time.

## Impact
The collateral's virtual price is less than it should be, so the collateral will be underestimated.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The update logic for `CollateralBook.updateVirtualPriceSlowly` is correct. Use the same logic as follows.

```solidity
- collateralBook.vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, virtualPrice, _currentBlockTime);
+ collateralBook.vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, virtualPrice, lastUpdateTime + threeMinuteDelta * 180);
```
