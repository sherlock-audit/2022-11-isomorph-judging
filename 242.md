# Lyra vault underestimates the collateral value

## Summary

Lyra vault subtracts the withdrawal fee while calculating the collateral value in USD, and it does not match the actual Lyra Pool implementation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The user's collateral value is estimated using the function `priceCollateralToUSD()` at `Vault_Lyra.sol#L77` as follows.

```solidity
function priceCollateralToUSD(bytes32 _currencyKey, uint256 _amount) public view override returns(uint256){
        //The LiquidityPool associated with the LP Token is used for pricing
    ILiquidityPoolAvalon LiquidityPool = ILiquidityPoolAvalon(collateralBook.liquidityPoolOf(_currencyKey));
    //we have already checked for stale greeks so here we call the basic price function.
    uint256 tokenPrice = LiquidityPool.getTokenPrice();
    uint256 withdrawalFee = _getWithdrawalFee(LiquidityPool);
    uint256 USDValue  = (_amount * tokenPrice) / LOAN_SCALE;
    //we remove the Liquidity Pool withdrawalFee
    //as there's no way to remove the LP position without paying this.
    uint256 USDValueAfterFee = USDValue * (LOAN_SCALE- withdrawalFee)/LOAN_SCALE;
    return(USDValueAfterFee);
}
```

So it is understood that the withdrawal fee is removed to get the reasonable value of the collateral.
But according to the [Lyra Pool implementation](https://github.com/lyra-finance/lyra-protocol/blob/master/contracts/LiquidityPool.sol#L341), the token price used for withdrawal is calculated using the function `_getTotalBurnableTokens`.
And the function `_getTotalBurnableTokens` is as belows.

```solidity
function _getTotalBurnableTokens()
    internal
    returns (
      uint tokensBurnable,
      uint tokenPriceWithFee,
      bool stale
    )
  {
    uint burnableLiquidity;
    uint tokenPrice;
    (tokenPrice, stale, burnableLiquidity) = _getTokenPriceAndStale();

    if (optionMarket.getNumLiveBoards() != 0) {
      tokenPriceWithFee = tokenPrice.multiplyDecimal(DecimalMath.UNIT - lpParams.withdrawalFee);
    } else {
      tokenPriceWithFee = tokenPrice;//@audit withdrawalFee is not applied if there are no live borads
    }

    return (burnableLiquidity.divideDecimal(tokenPriceWithFee), tokenPriceWithFee, stale);
  }
```

From the code, it is clear that the withdrawal fee is subtracted only when the related option market has live boards.
Because `Vault_Lyra.sol` applies a withdrawal fee all the time to price the collateral, it means the user's collateral is under-valued.

## Impact

User's collaterals are under-valued than reasonable and might get to a liquidatable status sooner than expected. A liquidator can abuse this to get an unfair profit by liquidating the user's collateral with the under-estimated value and withdrawing it from the Lyra pool without paying a withdrawal fee.

## Recommendation

Make sure to apply withdrawal fee consistent to how Lyra pool does.
