# Active loans should be checked before revoking MINTER_ROLE from vaults


## Summary

Removing MINTER_ROLE should do double check about the active user loans.

## Vulnerability Detail

Without MINTER_ROLE vaults can not burn the isoUSD tokens and users can not close loans.
So before removing a MINTER_ROLE from vaults, an additional process should be in place to double check the active loans to prevent possible loss of funds for the users. (It is notable that the interests will continue accrue while users can not close the loan)
Furthermore, `removeRole()` takes effect immediately and it takes `TIME_DELAY` to add a new role.
So it is strongly recommended to add a new logic to double check active loans in the function `removeRole()` when the role to revoke is MINTER_ROLE.

```solidity
// RoleControl.sol L#57
// @param _minter address that is already a minter and you wish to remove from this role.
// @notice reverts if address `_minter` did not already have the minter role.
function removeRole(address _account, bytes32 _role) external onlyAdmin{
    require(hasRole(_role, _account), "Address was not already specified role");
    _revokeRole(_role, _account);
    emit RemoveRole(_account, _role, msg.sender);
}
```

## Impact

Removing a MINTER_ROLE by mistake (or intentionally by a malicious admin) will force the user debts grow while users can not close the loans. Although this is an admin level vulnerability, I believe it is still worth pointing out because its impact is high and is avoidable by adding an additional check.
