# Average User is not able to monitor their position and view their liquidatable amount

## Summary

The viewLiquidatableAmount() function in the provided Solidity code is difficult for the average person to use, making it difficult for users to monitor their debt and position. This can potentially result in their position being liquidated without their knowledge.

## Vulnerability Detail

The viewLiquidatableAmount() function takes in four parameters: _collateralAmount, _collateralPrice, _userDebt, and _liquidatableMargin. The average person may not be familiar with these parameters and their values, making it difficult for them to use the function effectively.

Additionally, the function uses complex calculations to determine the liquidatable amount, which may be difficult for the average person to understand and interpret. This can lead to confusion and potentially incorrect usage of the function, leading to potential liquidation of the user's position without their knowledge.

## Impact

If the average person is unable to properly use the viewLiquidatableAmount() function, they may not be able to monitor their debt and position effectively. This can potentially result in their position being liquidated without their knowledge, leading to financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that the viewLiquidatableAmount() function be simplified and made more user-friendly. This can potentially be achieved by adding clear documentation and explanations of the function and its parameters, as well as simplifying the calculations used in the function. This will make it easier for the average person to use the function and monitor their debt and position effectively.

We recommend the project wrap the code below and expose the output as the single function so user can monitor their position (their liquidationAmount)

```solidity
            (
                bytes32 currencyKey,
                ,
                uint256 liquidatableMargin,
                ,
                ,
                uint256 virtualPrice,
                
            ) = _getCollateral(_collateralAddress);
            //check for frozen or paused collateral
            _checkIfCollateralIsActive(currencyKey);
            //check how much of the specified loan should be closed
            uint256 isoUSDBorrowed = (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][_loanHolder] * virtualPrice) / LOAN_SCALE;
            uint256 totalUserCollateral = collateralPosted[_collateralAddress][_loanHolder];
            uint256 currentPrice = priceCollateralToUSD(currencyKey, LOAN_SCALE); //assumes LOAN_SCALE = 1 ether, i.e. one unit of collateral!
            uint256 liquidationAmount = viewLiquidatableAmount(totalUserCollateral, currentPrice, isoUSDBorrowed, liquidatableMargin);
```
