# erc721 uses transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom which can cause loss of nft

## Summary
erc721 uses transferFrom in _returnAndSplitNFTs, if msg.sender is a smart contract that does not support erc721, the nft will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Nft will be lost if receiver is a smart contract that does not support erc721.

```solidity
         depositReceipt.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, newId);

         }
         else{
         userNFTs.ids[_loanNFTs.slots[i]] = 0;

        depositReceipt.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, _loanNFTs.ids[i]);

```
