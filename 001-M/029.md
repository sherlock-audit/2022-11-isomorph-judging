# Using `ERC721.transferFrom()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()` may cause the user's NFT to be frozen in a contract that does not support ERC721

## Summary
There are certain smart contracts that do not support ERC721, using `transferFrom()` may result in the NFT being sent to such contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
On method `_returnAndSplitNFTs` in [Vault_Velo.sol#L621](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L621) if `msg.sender` is a smart contract that do not support ERC721, using `transferFrom()` may result in the NFT being sent to such contracts.

## Impact
The NFT may get stuck in the contract that does support ERC721.


## Code Snippet
[Vault_Velo.sol#L638](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L638)
[Vault_Velo.sol#L642](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L642)

On [Vault_Velo.sol#L289](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L289) you may consider add `safeTransferFrom`, its not necesary for your contract because he knows how to handle this nfts, but its consider best practice to use `safeTransferFrom`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()`.
