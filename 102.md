# Wrong validation of _liquidationRatio in queueCollateralChange and addCollateralType

## Summary
The value of `_liquidationRatio` is checked to be such that `vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio >= 10 ** 36`. This protects against underflow when liquidating a loan, but does not protect against division by zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vaue of `_liquidationRatio` is checked in the following two lines to be such that `vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio >= 10 ** 36`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L111
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L307
This protects that, when liquidating a loan, there won't be an integer underflow here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L408
and here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L718

But if the value of `_liquidationRatio` is set to a value that satisfies `vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio = 10 ** 36`, although the underflow will not happen, the `denominator` will be zero and the following lines will cause a revert with division by zero:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L409
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Velo.sol#L719

## Impact
With the current configuration of the contracts, being `LIQUIDATION_RETURN = 95 ether /100`, there is no value possible of `_liquidationRatio` that can make this issue occur. Anyway, if the value of `LIQUIDATION_RETURN` can be set to another value in the future, this issue could arise and make the liquidations fail for all vaults (Lyra, Velo and Synth). Because the solution would be to reconfigure the collateral book with a valid `_liquidationRatio` and there is a 3 day delay to apply the changes, I rate the impact as High. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the following lines in `CollateralBook`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L111
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L307

With this:
```solidity
require( vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio > 10 ** 36, "Liquidation ratio too low");
```
