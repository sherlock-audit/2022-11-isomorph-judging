# Using `transferFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom` may cause the NFT to be frozen in a contract that does not support ERC721

## Summary

There are certain smart contracts that do not support ERC721, using `transferFrom()` may result in the NFT being sent to such contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `_returnAndSplitNFTs()` of `Vault_Velo.sol#L621`, deposit receipt NFTs are sent to the `msg.sender` and the msg sender can be either the original owner or the liquidator.
If a liquidator called liquidation from a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in that contract.

- [OpenZepplin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of `transferFrom()`, use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible

- As per the [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721):
  > A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

## Impact

The NFT may get stuck in the contract that does support ERC721.
