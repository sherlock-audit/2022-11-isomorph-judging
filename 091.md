# DepositReceipt_Base.split is unsafe if called by a user directly due to front running

## Summary
The `DepositReceipt_Base.split` function is used to split an existing NFT.
Ownership of the new NFT will then be transferred to the `relatedDepositor` of the existing NFT:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L95)

Transferring to the `relatedDepositor` does not allow the user that owns the original NFT to do anything with the new NFT (except withdraw the associated tokens and thereby burn it again) and it allows a front-running attack to occur.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls the `DepositReceipt_Base.split` function, a new NFT will be created and the owner is the `relatedDepositor`.
If the new NFT is not burnt in the same transaction, any other user can call `Depositor.withdrawFromGauge` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/Depositor.sol#L119) and get the pooledTokens.

## Impact
The pooledTokens associated with the new NFT can be stolen if the split function is called by a user and he doesn't withdraw the pooledTokens himself in the same transaction.

## Code Snippet
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L88-L102](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L88-L102)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are 2 options:
### Option 1
Add the `onlyMinter` modifier to the split function.
This is the safer option because it will prevent users from calling the function alltogether.

### Option 2
Make the `msg.sender` the owner of the new NFT:
```solidity
uint256 newNFTId = _mintNewNFT(newPooledTokens, msg.sender);
```
Thereby the owner of the new NFT will still be the Depositor contract if the split function is called by a Depositor (partial withdraw) and there will be no possibility for a front-running attack to withdraw the new NFT if the function is called by a user.
