# CollateralBook.CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY variable is mistakenly set to 200 sec instead of 2 days

## Summary
CollateralBook.CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY variable is mistakenly set to 200 sec instead of 2 days. As result admin can make changes for collateral assets much quicker then he should.
## Vulnerability Detail
CollateralBook.CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY variable is used in changeCollateralType function to check if enough time has passed to change collateral asset params.

```solidity
    function changeCollateralType() external onlyAdmin {
        uint256 submissionTimestamp = queuedTimestamp;
        require(submissionTimestamp != 0, "Uninitialized collateral change");
        require(submissionTimestamp + CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY <= block.timestamp, "Not enough time passed");
        address collateralAddress = queuedCollateralAddress;
        bytes32 currencyKey = queuedCurrencyKey;
        uint256 minimumRatio = queuedMinimumRatio;
        uint256 liquidationRatio = queuedLiquidationRatio;
        uint256 interestPer3Min = queuedInterestPer3Min;
        address liquidityPool = queuedLiquidityPool;
        


        //Now we must ensure interestPer3Min changes aren't applied retroactively
        // by updating the assets virtualPrice to current block timestamp
        uint256 timeDelta = (block.timestamp - collateralProps[collateralAddress].lastUpdateTime) / THREE_MIN;
        if (timeDelta != 0){ 
           updateVirtualPriceSlowly(collateralAddress, timeDelta );
        }
        bytes32 oldCurrencyKey = collateralProps[collateralAddress].currencyKey;


        _changeCollateralParameters(
            collateralAddress,
            currencyKey,
            minimumRatio,
            liquidationRatio,
            interestPer3Min
        );
        //Then update LiqPool as this isn't stored in the struct and requires the currencyKey also.
        liquidityPoolOf[oldCurrencyKey]= address(0); 
        liquidityPoolOf[currencyKey]= liquidityPool;
        
    }
```
The variable CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY  [should be](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L23) 2 days as you see in comments, but it is set to 200 seconds instead.
## Impact
Admin can do actions faster then he should.
