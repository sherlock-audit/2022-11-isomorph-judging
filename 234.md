# The protocol shouldn't charge interests when paused



## Summary
The protocol charges interest from users using `virtualPrice` and it increases when the protocol is paused.

As a result, users would be forced to pay more interests and experience an unexpected liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol has 3 kinds of the vault and each one has `pause/unpause` option by `pausers`.

Also, each collateral would be paused using `CollateralBook.pauseCollateralType()`.

But it updates the `virtualPrice` during the paused period and the below scenarios would be possible.

#### Scenario 1
1. A user `Alice` opened a loan using some collaterals.
2. The vault was paused for a while for some unexpected reason.
3. Meanwhile, her loan was changed to a `liquidatable` one but she can't add collaterals(or close the loan) in the paused state.
4. After the protocol is unpaused, she's trying to protect her loan by adding collaterals but `Bob` can liquidate her loan with front running.
5. Even if her loan isn't liquidated, she should pay interests during the paused period and it's not fair for her.

#### Scenario 2
1. A user `Alice` opened a loan with `minOpeningMargin = 101%`.
2. After the protocol was paused for some reason, the admin decided to change `minOpeningMargin = 105%`.
3. `Alice` wants to close her loan before it's applied because it's too high for her but she can't because it's paused.
4. After the new `minOpeningMargin` is applied, `Alice` will be forced to pay interests of the higher `minOpeningMargin` for the paused period.

When I check other protocols to charge interests, it's normal to enable some ways to protect their loans during the paused period for users.

Currently, all functions don't work in the paused mode and it shouldn't charge interests in this case.

## Impact
Users might be forced to pay more interests or their loans might be liquidated unexpectedly.

## Recommendation
We shouldn't increase the `virtualPrice` during the paused period.
