# Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for erc721 transfers

## Summary
It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() when transferring ERC721.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are 2 main reasons.

Firstly, OpenZeppelin discourages the use of transferFrom(); use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible
(See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-)

Secondly, there could be some logic in the onERC721Received() function, which only triggered in safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom()

## Impact
There is the potential loss of NFTs where the recipient is unable to handle the sent ERC721.
