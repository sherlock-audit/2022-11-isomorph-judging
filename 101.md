# use the appropriate time

## Summary
in solidity you can use time units as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years.
## Vulnerability Detail
the contract you have defined constants as uints without actually stating that they are time uints which is a different thing.
## Impact
they will the contract when they messured against the block.timestamp as they are not time units. also when diving the math wont be accurate where they are used. dividing by 3 minutes is the same as dividing by 180.
