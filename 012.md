# The variable `totalUSDborrowed` is wrongly calculated on opening a loan in Vault_Synths.

## Summary
The variable `totalUSDborrowed` is wrongly calculated on opening a loan in Vault_Synths.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `openLoan()`, the variable totalUSDborrowed is supposed to be calculated based on how much the user wants to borrow more and how much he already borrowed + the interest accrued on the borrowed amount.
With the issue occurring here, the wrong mapping `isoUSDLoaned` is used instead of `isoUSDLoanAndInterest`. 
And as how it is right now, the variable totalUSDborrowed will be equal to a wrong amount without the interest applied in it.

You can see that the right mapping was used in Vault_Lyra.

Currently users can taka advantage of that and borrow more isoUSD than they're supposed to, ignoring the interest accrued on the amount they already borrowed.

## Impact
Duo to a mistake made in the function `openLoan()` in Vault_Synths, the variable totalUSDborrowed is wrongly calculated.

## Recommendation
Fix the issue by using the right mapping:
`totalUSDborrowed = _USDborrowed +  (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice)/LOAN_SCALE;`
