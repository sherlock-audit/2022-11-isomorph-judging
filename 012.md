# The variable `totalUSDborrowed` is wrongly calculated in the function openLoan in Vault_Synths. Users who want to increase their loans will receive less isoUSD.

## Summary
The variable `totalUSDborrowed` is wrongly calculated in the function `openLoan()` in Vault_Synths.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `openLoan()`, the variable `totalUSDborrowed` is wrongly calculated.
With the issue occurring here, the wrong mapping `isoUSDLoaned` is used instead of `isoUSDLoanAndInterest`. 
And as how it is right now, the variable `totalUSDborrowed` will be equal to a wrong amount (bigger amount),
preventing users from getting their full amount of isoUSD, when they call openLoan to increase their loan.

`When the first time someone opens a loan, everything will be normal.`
`The problem occurs if they already opened a loan and want to increase it, by calling the function openLoan again.`

`Note: ignoring the minimum loan size of 100 isoUSD (100 * 10^18), so the example can be more understandable.`
`The same argument works for larger values.`

Example:
Kiki opened a loan with the params: _colAmount = 1000, _USDborrowed = 1000.

// Let's say virtual price is 1.10 * 1 ether.
As a result his mappings will look like this:
`collateralPosted[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = 1000;`
`isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = 1000;`
`isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] = 909`

Later Kiki decides that he wants to increase his loan with the same params as the first one. 
This time Kiki will be able to borrow less isoUSD duo to the wrong mapping applied.

// Let's say the virtual price became 1.11 * 1 ether than the last time.

What totalUSDborrowed will show with the wrong mapping:
`totalUSDborrowed = _USDborrowed +  (isoUSDLoan[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice)/LOAN_SCALE;`
`totalUSDborrowed = 1 000 +  (1 000 * (1.11 * 1 ether)) / 1 ether` => `totalUSDborrowed = 2111`

What totalUSDborrowed is supposed to show with the right mapping:
`totalUSDborrowed = _USDborrowed +  (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice)/LOAN_SCALE;`
`totalUSDborrowed = 1 000 +  (909 * (1.11 * 1 ether)) / 1 ether` => `totalUSDborrowed => 2008`

As you can see with the wrong mapping there is a difference. 
Kiki won't be able to borrow his full amount of isoUSD duo to the wrong mapping applied.

The issue occurs in the function `openLoan()` in vault_synths on L120.

## Impact
Duo to a mistake made in the function `openLoan()` in Vault_Synths, the variable `totalUSDborrowed` is wrongly calculated duo to the wrong mapping used. Which leads to the issue described in `Vulnerability Detail`.

## Recommendation
Fix the issue by using the right mapping:
`totalUSDborrowed = _USDborrowed +  (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice)/LOAN_SCALE;`
