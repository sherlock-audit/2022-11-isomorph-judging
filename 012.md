# The variable `totalUSDborrowed` is wrongly calculated on opening a loan in Vault_Synths.

## Summary
The variable `totalUSDborrowed` is wrongly calculated on opening a loan in Vault_Synths.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `openLoan()`, the variable totalUSDborrowed is supposed to be calculated based on how much the user wants to borrow more and how much he already borrowed + the interest accrued. With the issue occurring here, the wrong mapping 
`isoUSDLoaned` is used instead of `isoUSDLoanAndInterest`. And as how it is right now, the variable totalUSDborrowed will be equal to a wrong amount without the interest applied in it.

You can see that the right mapping was used in Vault_Lyra.

Fix the issue by using the right mapping:
