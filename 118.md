# Dangerous check of token in depositor receipts

## Summary
In the constructors of both USDC and ETH Depositor Receipts, the way the contract checks one of the tokens provided is USDC or WETH is through the token symbol. This is dangerous because it introduces an attack vector in the system, and is not necessary because the USDC and WETH addresses are hardcoded in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The checks for the USDC and ETH tokens is done via the token symbol here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L42-L47
and here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L46-L51
The addresses of USDC and WETH are hardcoded in both contracts:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L10
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L10
The constructor should check the token address instead of the token symbol, otherwise this could be bypassed by a malicious actor feeding in a malicious token in case that the multisig gets compromised.
A malicious token with symbol USDC (the same would apply for WETH) and different number of decimals (6 for USDC), could be used to produce wrong `_priceCollateral` calculations in `Vault_Velo` contract which could lead for instance to allowing opening a loan below the borrow margin value.

## Impact
Medium. Although unlikely to happen, this attack vector could be completely removed by comparing token addresses instead of token symbols.

## Recommendation

Substitute the token symbol checks for address checks:
Change:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_USDC.sol#L45
with:
```solidity
if (token0 == USDC){
```
And:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_ETH.sol#L49
with:
```solidity
if (token0 == WETH){
```
