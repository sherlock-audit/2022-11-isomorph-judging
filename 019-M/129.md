# CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY in collateral book is wrongly hardcoded to 200 seconds instead of 2 days

## Summary

The contract CollateralBook contains a vulnerability where the timelock for changing collateral parameters is too short.

## Vulnerability Detail

The changeCollateralType() function, which is responsible for changing the parameters of a collateral token, is protected by a timelock. However, the timelock delay is set to 200 seconds (CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY = 200), which is significantly shorter than the intended delay of 2 days (as indicated by the comment in the code //2 days). This means that an attacker could potentially call the queueCollateralChange() function and then immediately call the changeCollateralType() function to bypass the timelock and change the collateral parameters.

## Impact

An attacker could use this vulnerability to manipulate the parameters of a collateral token, potentially allowing them to create undercollateralized loans or to liquidate loans that are not actually undercollateralized.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The timelock delay in the changeCollateralType() function should be set to 2 days (or some other sufficiently long duration) in order to prevent attackers from bypassing the timelock.
