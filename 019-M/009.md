# Collateral can be changed in less than intended 3 or 2 day governance timelock

## Summary
`changeCollateralType()` waits for `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` amount of time from when it was queued before changing the collateral type details. `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` is however hardcoded to 200 which means 200 seconds and is not 2 days as mentioned in the comment or 3 days as mentioned in the documentation markdown.

## Vulnerability Detail
`CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` is hardcoded to 200 seconds instead of the intended 2 or 3 days time. So collateral type details can be changed within 200 seconds of it being queued making the timelock almost redundant and useless.

## Impact
Collateral details can be changed in less than 200 seconds of it being queued.

## Code Snippet
The line [here](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L23) defined the value of `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` which is used by the [timelock in changeCollateralType() function](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L130) be changed as below
`public constant CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY = 2 days`

## Tool used

## Recommendation
change to the below line
