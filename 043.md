# Depositor.sol: Funds can be withdrawn from any Depositor contract leading to loss of rewards and funds

## Summary
For one `DepositReceipt` contract (`DepositReceipt_USDC` or `DepositReceipt_ETH`), users can create `Depositor` contracts using the `Templater` contract.
One `Depositor` contract belongs to a specific address that is the owner of the `Depositor` contract.
Only the owner of the `Depositor` contract can call the `Depositor.depositToGauge` function.

The `Depositor.withdrawFromGauge` function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/Depositor.sol#L119) however can be called by any user as long as he has transferred ownership of the NFT to the `Depositor` or has approved the `Depositor`.

The issue is that a User 1 can use Depositor contract A to withdraw funds that were deposited to the gauge using Depositor contract B.

This means that the User 2 that has created the Depositor A can no longer withdraw his funds from Depositor A.
He must find the Depositor B (or any other Depositor with sufficient funds deposited to the gauge) to withdraw funds from.

You might say that technically here can no funds be lost. User A must "just" find Depositor B and can withdraw his funds there.

This is not true however. Think of a smart contract that creates a Depositor and can only withdraw from this specific Depositor. If this is no longer possible, the funds are lost.

There is a further porblem:
The rewards can only be withdrawn from the `Depositor` by the owner.
So an attacker can withdraw his funds from a victim's `Depositor` contract. Thereby the victim can no longer earn rewards. The attacker can however still earn rewards for the funds that were deposited using his `Depositor` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
See above section.

## Impact
Loss of funds in the form of only rewards or in some cases (Smart Contract can only interact with a specific `Depositor`) loss of deposited funds as well.

## Code Snippet
See other sections.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `Depositor` contract must keep track of the NFTs that it has minted and only allow withdrawals with these NFTs.
