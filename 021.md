# Isomorph.ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY uses 3 sec delay instead of 3 days

## Summary
Isomorph.ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY uses 3 sec delay instead of 3 days. As result roles can be added quickly than they should.
## Vulnerability Detail
Isomorph.ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY [is set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/isoUSDToken.sol#L10) to 3 and supposes to be 3 days instead. This value is passed to RoleControl constructor and is used as a delay to set roles.

In this case the value is set to 3 seconds instead of 3 days and roles can be added faster.
## Impact
Roles can be added faster by owner.
