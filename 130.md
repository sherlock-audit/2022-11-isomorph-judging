# Self-liquidation should not be allowed in the vault

## Summary

The callLiquidation function in the contract allows a user to liquidate themselves, which can be exploited to avoid paying debt and interest.

## Vulnerability Detail

The callLiquidation function has no checks to prevent a user from liquidating themselves. This allows the user to liquidate their own loan, transferring their collateral to themselves at a 5% discount, while avoiding any remaining debt and interest.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows users to exploit the system and avoid paying their debt and interest. This can lead to financial losses for the contract and damage its reputation.

## Code Snippet

and the function in Synthetic vault and the Vault_Velo as well.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this issue, the callLiquidation function should include a check to prevent a user from liquidating themselves. This can be done by comparing the msg.sender with the _loanHolder address, and only allowing the liquidation to proceed if they are different. This will ensure that only other users can liquidate a loan, preventing self-liquidation.
