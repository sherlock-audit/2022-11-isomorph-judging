# _interestPer3Min in queueCollateralChange function should have boundary validation



## Summary
_interestPer3Min in queueCollateralChange should have boundary validation
## Vulnerability Detail
CollateralBook's `queueCollateralChange` function enforces a timelock for changing collateral. The `_interestPer3Min` parameter is proposed to be changed with the `changeCollateralType` afterward.
However, the new `_interestPer3Min` is not validated compared to the existing one. A larger value or a missed decimal might result in the collateral holders' loss of their funds excessively. Having a 10% fee instead of 0,0001% would not be fair.
## Impact
Loss of funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function queueCollateralChange(
        address _collateralAddress,
        bytes32 _currencyKey,
        uint256 _minimumRatio,
        uint256 _liquidationRatio,
        uint256 _interestPer3Min,
        uint256 _assetType,
        address _liquidityPool

    ) external collateralExists(_collateralAddress) onlyAdmin {
        require(_collateralAddress != address(0));
        require(_minimumRatio > _liquidationRatio);
        require(_liquidationRatio != 0);
        require(vaults[_assetType] != address(0), "Vault not deployed yet");
        IVault vault = IVault(vaults[_assetType]);
        //prevent setting liquidationRatio too low such that it would cause an overflow in callLiquidation, see appendix on liquidation maths for details.
        require( vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio >= 10 ** 36, "Liquidation ratio too low");

        queuedCollateralAddress = _collateralAddress;
        queuedCurrencyKey = _currencyKey;
        queuedMinimumRatio = _minimumRatio;
        queuedLiquidationRatio = _liquidationRatio;
        queuedInterestPer3Min = _interestPer3Min;
        queuedLiquidityPool = _liquidityPool;
        queuedTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the param _interestPer3Min should be in the boundaries where it should not drain the users.
