# Time delay for RoleControl in isoUSDToken contract has a wrong value

## Summary
The time delay for role proposals in the `isoUSDToken`  contract has a value of three seconds, when this should be three days like it is in the rest of contracts.
Note that it happens something similar in CollateralBook contract with `uint256 public constant CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY = 200; //2 days`, which should be 2 days but it is 200 seconds instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is a 'trick' made by the team to make the tests pass and avoid errors with the oracle (as pointed out in the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/README.md). 
>Update ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY in isoUSDToken.sol to a shorter time than it's expected 3 days value. For tests 3 seconds is suggested. This is necessary to test Vault_Lyra.sol and Vault_Synths.sol because both rely on external oracles which will break functionality if we skip 3 days ahead and do not update them, updating them is too convoluted so instead we just use a shorter timelock for testing.


But as the files in scope contain this issue I find it suitable to report this (just for the team at Isomorph to be aware the contracts have test values and not production values for these constants) although it may be downgraded.

## Impact
Medium impact, because the team is aware of this and the likeability of not noticing there are test values set in the contracts, and deploy them to mainnet is low.

## Recommendation
Update this line:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/isoUSDToken.sol#L10
with this:
```solidity
uint256 constant ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY = 3 days;
```
And line:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L23
with this:
```solidity
uint256 public constant CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY = 2 days;
```
