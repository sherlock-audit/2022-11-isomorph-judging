# virtualPrice exponentially increases and can block some loans or the entire contract

## Summary

virtualPrice is set to the values of a geometric series which grows exponentially so there is a risk that it overflows at some point and eventually blocks some loans or the entire contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let N be the number of 3 minutes cycles from the contract creation to the current time. Let say interestPer3Min was constant during that period, the `virtualPrice` at cycle N is equal to: `1 ether * (interestPer3Min / LOAN_SCALE)**N`.
Since it's exponentially growing, as time moves forward there is more and more chances that an operation on a loan reverts because of an overflow when multiplying by `virtualPrice`.

## Impact

Block some loans or the entire contract since `_updateVirtualPrice` is called in each function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Why not compute the interests per user directly instead of keeping a virtualPrice that is always growing? It would also avoid the costs of the for loop in _updateVirtualPrice.
