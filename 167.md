# `dailyMax` mechanism logic problem

## Summary
`dailyMax` mechanism logic problem
## Vulnerability Detail
The design of `dailyMax` is to ensure that only `dailyMax` can be borrowed per day. But I only considered borrowing, not paying it back on the same day. In extreme cases, if a malicious user borrows `dailyMax` on the same day, and then immediately repays `dailyMax` and interest. Then other users cannot borrow again on the same day. Even though the funds in the vault haven't changed. It can also be that multiple users borrow on the same day and return it on the same day. When the loan amount reaches `dailyMax`. Consent also occurs.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function _checkDailyMaxLoans(uint256 _amountAdded) internal {  
        if (block.timestamp > dayCounter + 1 days ){
            dailyTotal = _amountAdded;
            dayCounter = block.timestamp;
        }
        else{
            dailyTotal += _amountAdded;
        }
        require( dailyTotal  < dailyMax, "Try again tomorrow loan opening limit hit");
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider that if the loan is completed on the same day, then the dailyMax of the day must be modified in the `_decreaseLoan()` function.
