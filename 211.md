# Validation of the queued collateral is not carried out as parameter `_collateralAddress` is in the correct `_liquidityPool`



## Summary
Validation of the queued collateral is not carried out as parameter `_collateralAddress` is in the correct `_liquidityPool`
## Vulnerability Detail
CollateralBook's `queueCollateralChange` function creates a queue to change the collateral parameters. And as a second step, `changeCollateralType` function is called after the timelock period ends. But in both functions, there is no validation of `_collateralAddress` parameter being in the correct `_liquidityPool` for Lyra collaterals. These functions are performed behind the admin privilege, however, it's vulnerable to incorrect addresses.
## Impact
Zero price or wrong price feed that can damage the protocol in bad debt.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function queueCollateralChange(
        address _collateralAddress,
        bytes32 _currencyKey,
        uint256 _minimumRatio,
        uint256 _liquidationRatio,
        uint256 _interestPer3Min,
        uint256 _assetType,
        address _liquidityPool

    ) external collateralExists(_collateralAddress) onlyAdmin {
        require(_collateralAddress != address(0));
        require(_minimumRatio > _liquidationRatio);
        require(_liquidationRatio != 0);
        require(vaults[_assetType] != address(0), "Vault not deployed yet");
        IVault vault = IVault(vaults[_assetType]);
        //prevent setting liquidationRatio too low such that it would cause an overflow in callLiquidation, see appendix on liquidation maths for details.
        require( vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio >= 10 ** 36, "Liquidation ratio too low");

        queuedCollateralAddress = _collateralAddress;
        queuedCurrencyKey = _currencyKey;
        queuedMinimumRatio = _minimumRatio;
        queuedLiquidationRatio = _liquidationRatio;
        queuedInterestPer3Min = _interestPer3Min;
        queuedLiquidityPool = _liquidityPool;
        queuedTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate `_liquidityPool` versus `_collateralAddress` for Lyra collaterals.
