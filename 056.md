# Vault_Base_ERC20#_checkDailyMaxLoans daily rollover time is inconsistent

## Summary

`Vault_Base_ERC20#_checkDailyMaxLoans` tracks the amount of loans taken each day and confirms that the amount of loans opened in a day doesn't surpass the limit. When resetting the counter it sets the `dayCounter` to `block.Timestamp` which will track daily deposits incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function _checkDailyMaxLoans(uint256 _amountAdded) internal {
        if (block.timestamp > dayCounter + 1 days ){
            dailyTotal = _amountAdded;
            dayCounter = block.timestamp;
        }
        else{
            dailyTotal += _amountAdded;
        }
        require( dailyTotal  < dailyMax, "Try again tomorrow loan opening limit hit");
    }

The daily deposits are tracked incorrectly because the time at which the day rolls over will be inconsistent and vary based on when loans are taken out.

Example:
Assume the `dailyMax` = 100 isoUSD. On Monday @ 12:00 a user opens a loan for 100 isoUSD. This sets `dayCounter` to Monday @ 12:00 and dailyTotal to 100. On Tuesday @ 11:00 a user tries to open a loan for 10 isoUSD but the transaction reverts even though its a new day.

## Impact

The time at which the day rolls over will be inconsistent and vary based on when loans are taken out

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Truncate block.timestamp so that days rollover at the same time each day. Another small fix is that `dailyTotal` should be inclusive of `dailyMax`:

        function _checkDailyMaxLoans(uint256 _amountAdded) internal {
            if (block.timestamp > dayCounter + 1 days ){
                dailyTotal = _amountAdded;
    -           dayCounter = block.timestamp;
    +           //truncate block.timestamp so that counter rolls over at the same time each day
    +           dayCounter = (block.timestamp / 1 days) * 1 days;
            }
            else{
                dailyTotal += _amountAdded;
            }
    -       require(dailyTotal  < dailyMax, "Try again tomorrow loan opening limit hit");
    +       require(dailyTotal  <= dailyMax, "Try again tomorrow loan opening limit hit");
        }
