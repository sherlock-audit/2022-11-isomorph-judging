# Use of a hardcoded assumption of 1 USDC = 1 USD can lead into all protocol to fail and loss of value

# Use of a hardcoded assumption of 1 USDC = 1 USD can lead into all protocol to fail and loss of value
## Summary
As it has been seen in LUNA and all the protocols that use the assumption of 1 UST == 1 USD, this can literally break all the protocol and affect all the value.

## Vulnerability Detail
Hardcoded assumption of money is wrong, therefore, USDC can depeg and affect `priceLiquidity`, `totalCollateralValue`, etc. This would also affect `openLoan` an other functions that would create a loss of funds in depeg.

Depeg can happen because of different reasons
- Temporal depeg as seen in usdt a couple weeks ago due to tweets and fud
- Totally depeg, as seen in LUNA
- Depeg due to bankrun
- Depeg due to a Circle (USDC) bad use of funds or just bad moment of the market and need to sell bonds at less price
- Collateral depeg as can happen if for example Circle has Coinbase bonds and Coinbase can't save his own business and therefore can't repay it
- FED or SEC using his power again Circle and not allowing them to redeem the money

## Impact
Functionalities being in a totally unexpected behavior and loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't assume 1 USDC == 1 USD and use the market value.
