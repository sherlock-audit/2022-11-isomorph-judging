# Lack of input validation that check `minimum value` of `_percentageSplit`

## Summary
- Lack of input validation that check `minimum value` of `_percentageSplit`

## Vulnerability Detail
- `_percentageSplit` that is the percentage of the pooled tokens is assigned into the `split()` function. And the assigned-value of `_percentageSplit` is checked at the [L89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L89) .
  - At the [L89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L89), the maximum value of `_percentageSplit` is checked by using `BASE`. 
  (NOTEï¼š`BASE` is `1e18` that indicate `100%` )
```solidity
require(_percentageSplit < BASE, "split must be less than 100%");
```
   
- On the other hand, the minimum value of `_percentageSplit` is not checked.
  - In case very small value of percentage is inputted into the `_percentageSplit` such as `1e10` (= `0.0000001%` ) and the amount of `existingPooledTokens` is very small such as `1e7` , this transaction could fail at the [L93](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L93) due to underflow.
```solidity
uint256 newPooledTokens = (existingPooledTokens * _percentageSplit)/ BASE;
```  
  
## Impact
- Transaction could fail due to underflow.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Should add an input validation for checking the minimum value of `_percentageSplit` to [L89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L89) .
  - eg). If this protocol set the minimum value of `_percentageSplit` is more than `1%` ( `1e16` ), an input validation for checking the minimum value of `_percentageSplit` is added like below:
```solidity
require(1e16 <= _percentageSplit < BASE, "split must be less than 100%");
```
