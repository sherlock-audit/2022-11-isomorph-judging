# Depositor.sol contract deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens

## Summary
There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`. 
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The Depositor's depositToGauge() and function transfer `_amount` to this contract using `AMMToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);`.This could have a fee, and less than `_amount` ends up in the contract. The next actual vault deposit using `gauge.deposit(_amount, 0);` will then try to transfer more than `this` contract actually has and will revert the transaction.

                      'AMMToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);'

                 'gauge.deposit(_amount, 0);'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible mitigation is measuring the asset change before and after the asset-transferring routines.
