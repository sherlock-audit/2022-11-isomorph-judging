# Vault_Synths: false calculation of USD debt allows under-collateralized loans

## Summary
The `Vault_Synths.openLoan` function has a flaw that causes the total amount of USD borrowed to be calculated incorrectly. This in turn causes the `borrowMargin` to be calculated incorrectly.

The issue lies in line 120 in `Vault_Synths.sol`:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L120) 

In order to calculate `totalUSDborrowed`, the `isoUSDLoanAndInterest` mapping must be used and NOT the `isoUSDLoaned` mapping.

This became clear to me when comparing this instance to all the other instances where `totalUSDborrowed` is calculated. Even in the same `Vault_Synths.sol` file there are instances where `totalUSDborrowed` is calculated correctly:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L289](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L289)

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L174](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L174)

In the next section I will investigate the impact of this issue. 
This will make it clear that the issue can be used to create under-collateralized loans, thereby essentially stealing money.

## Vulnerability Detail
Two cases must be differentiated:
### Falsely calculated `borrowMargin` is higher than actual `borrowMargin`
This occurs when `isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]` is greater than `isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]`.
In this case the user can borrow less USD than he should be able to.

### Falsely calculated `borrowMargin` is lower than actual `borrowMargin`
This occurs when `isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]` is smaller than `isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]`.
This is the more dangerous case because it means that the `minOpeningMargin` is not reached.
Obviously if the difference between the calculated `borrowMargin` and the actual `borrowMargin` is sufficiently big, the actual collateral might not even be sufficient to be above the `liquidatableMargin`.

So essentially a loan is created that is instantly liquidatable.
The `isoUSDBorrowed` could even be so small that the loan is under-collateralized which means that there is a loss to the lender.

**But how can this happen?**

User A creates a fresh loan of $1000 with 20% interest per year.

After a year, User A pays back $1000 by calling `Vault_Synths.sol`.
`isoUSDLoaned[_collateralAddress][msg.sender]` will be set to 0 even though there is still debt left.
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L235](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L235)

When User A now borrows $200 new USD by calling `Vault_Synths.openLoan`, the `totalUSDborrowed` will only be `$200`, even though the debt is still $200, which means the total amount borrowed should be $400.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Synths.sol#L120) 

At this point there must be sufficient collateral for a debt of additional $200 since the `closeLoan` function makes sure this is the case.
So User A can borrow $200 now without providing any more collateral.
The debt is now $400 but there is only enough collateral for a debt of $200.

**So the loan is now under-collateralized** (assuming "enough collateral" is smaller than $400)

The more interest that there is accrued compared to the loan principal, the more severe this issue becomes.

## Impact
The worst case is that under-collateralized loans are created which means there is an instant loss to the lender and free money for the borrower.
