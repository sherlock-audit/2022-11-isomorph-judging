# vaults can stop working when new collateral is added or changed

## Summary
Vaults like ``Vault_Lyra`` internally use information from the mapping of ``CollateralBook#liquidityPoolOf``. This mapping can be mistakenly overwritten when new collateral is added or changed. If it happens that a new vault is used for the new collateral that has the same ``currencyKey`` but different address for the internal pool than in this case the previous vault will stop working because the overwritten pool address.

## Vulnerability Detail
When adding/changing collateral the pool address used internally by some vaults and can be overwritten at the following lines:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L155-L156

The vault like ``Lyra_Vault`` depend on this pool address to be set correctly.

## Impact
A new added or changed collateral can break functionality of a previously existing vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of a direct mapping I suggest to use two level mapping to first address the assetType/vault then the pool address.

```diff
    function addCollateralType(
        address _collateralAddress,
        bytes32 _currencyKey,
        uint256 _minimumRatio,
        uint256 _liquidationRatio,
        uint256 _interestPer3Min,
        uint256 _assetType,
        address _liquidityPool
        ) external onlyAdmin {

        require(!collateralValid[_collateralAddress], "Collateral already exists");
        require(!collateralPaused[_collateralAddress], "Collateral already exists");
        require(_collateralAddress != address(0));
        require(_minimumRatio > _liquidationRatio);
        require(_liquidationRatio > 0);
        require(vaults[_assetType] != address(0), "Vault not deployed yet");
        IVault vault = IVault(vaults[_assetType]);

        //prevent setting liquidationRatio too low such that it would cause an overflow in callLiquidation, see appendix on liquidation maths for details.
        require( vault.LIQUIDATION_RETURN() *_liquidationRatio >= 10 ** 36, "Liquidation ratio too low"); //i.e. 1 when multiplying two 1 ether scale numbers.
        collateralValid[_collateralAddress] = true;
        collateralProps[_collateralAddress] = Collateral(
            _currencyKey,
            _minimumRatio,
            _liquidationRatio,
            _interestPer3Min,
            block.timestamp,
            1 ether,
            _assetType
            );
        //Then update LiqPool as this isn't stored in the struct and requires the currencyKey also.
-       liquidityPoolOf[_currencyKey]= _liquidityPool; 
+       liquidityPoolOf[vaults[_assetType]][_currencyKey] = _liqudityPool;
    }
```

And inside a vault..in this case the ``Vault_Lyra``
```diff
-   ILiquidityPoolAvalon LiquidityPool = ILiquidityPoolAvalon(collateralBook.liquidityPoolOf(_currencyKey));
+   ILiquidityPoolAvalon LiquidityPool = ILiquidityPoolAvalon(collateralBook.liquidityPoolOf(address(this), _currencyKey));
```

When changing a collateral I would remove the changing of the pool mapping hear and instead add new methods that will change this pool address property per used vault something like like ``setVaultPool(address vault, address pool)`` that is only callable by the contract owner and verifies first that the vault is used in the system.
