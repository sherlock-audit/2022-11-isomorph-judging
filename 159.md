# In some cases a hundred tokens is a too large value to use for pricing liquidity

## Summary
In `DepositReceipt_ETH.sol` and `DepositReceipt_USDC.sol` in `priceLiquidity` l:87:
In some cases a hundred tokens is a large value (example wBTC: equivalent to 1M$), and would cause critical functionality to revert due to checks in `priceLiquidity`

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker could provide liquidity to the pool and temporarily stabilize price to pass the checks. Then during normal market conditions his positions cannot be liquidated due to a revert in `priceLiquidity`.

## Impact
The condition is too strict for some type of tokens, and may lead to some users not being able to be liquidated. Leading to bad debt for the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adapt this `probing` value to be a function of the price of the token itself.
