# priceLiquidity in DepositReceipt_USDC and DepositReceipt_ETH returns value in incorrect decimal

## Summary
In `Vault_Velo`, priceLiquidity is used to calculate the value of the total collateral value. However, priceLiquidity returns the value in an incorrect decimal point. This causes the total collateral value to be lower. Therefore, user opening loan will be able to borrow lesser than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
For priceLiquidity in `DepositReceipt_USDC`, one token has to be usdc and the other has to be some other token. The usdc is scaled to 18 dp. 
However, the other non-usdc token ` value1 = (token1Amount * getOraclePrice()) / oracleBase;` after dividing by oracleBase, has no decimal point. The sum of both values is then returned.

            bool stablePool; //if the traded pool is stable or volatile.
            (amountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(HUNDRED_TOKENS, token1, USDC);
            require(stablePool == stable, "pricing occuring through wrong pool" );

            uint256 oraclePrice = getOraclePrice(priceFeed, tokenMaxPrice, tokenMinPrice);
            amountOut = (amountOut * oracleBase) / USDC_BASE / HUNDRED; //shift USDC amount to same scale as oracle

        }
        //token1 must be USDC 
        else {
            //hardcode value of USDC at $1
            //check swap value of 100tokens to USDC to protect against flash loan attacks
            uint256 amountOut; //amount received by trade
            bool stablePool; //if the traded pool is stable or volatile.
            (amountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(HUNDRED_TOKENS, token0, USDC);
            require(stablePool == stable, "pricing occuring through wrong pool" );

            uint256 oraclePrice = getOraclePrice(priceFeed, tokenMaxPrice, tokenMinPrice);
            amountOut = (amountOut * oracleBase) / USDC_BASE / HUNDRED; //shift USDC amount to same scale as oracle

            //calculate acceptable deviations from oracle price
            uint256 lowerBound = (oraclePrice * (BASE - ALLOWED_DEVIATION)) / BASE;
            uint256 upperBound = (oraclePrice * (BASE + ALLOWED_DEVIATION)) / BASE;
            //because 1 USDC = $1 we can compare its amount directly to bounds
            require(lowerBound < amountOut, "Price shift low detected");
            require(upperBound > amountOut, "Price shift high detected");

            value1 = token1Amount * SCALE_SHIFT;
           
            value0 = (token0Amount * oraclePrice) / oracleBase;
        }
        //Invariant: both value0 and value1 are in ETH scale 18.d.p now
        //USDC has only 6 decimals so we bring it up to the same scale as other 18d.p ERC20s
        return(value0 + value1);
    }
```
You can see that oracleBase is the decimals that the oracle is based on. By dividing it, non-usdc value has no decimal point.

```solidity
        oracleBase = 10 ** priceFeed.decimals();  //Chainlink USD oracles have 8d.p.
```

Same for priceLiquidity DepositReceipt_ETH, it returns the sum of both token values and divide the oracle's decimal point, therefore returning values with no decimal point.

            value1 = token1Amount * ETHOraclePrice;
            
            value0 = token0Amount * tokenOraclePrice;
        }
        // because value0 and value1 are in the same scale we can reduce them to 1e18 scale after adding.
        return((value0 + value1)/oracleBase);
    }
```

## Impact
priceLiquidity will return a lower amount, causing user to be able to borrow lesser with lesser total collaterized value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
According to the sponsor, 18 dp is expected. Therefore, scale both up to 18dp and return the sum of both for priceLiquidity in DepositReceipt_USDC 
```solidity
 value0 = token1Amount * SCALE_SHIFT;
 value1 = (token1Amount * getOraclePrice() * 1e18) / oracleBase;
return (value1+value2);
```

For DepositReceipt_ETH, scale to 1e18. 
```solidity

return (value1+value2)* 1e18 /oracleBase;
```
