# Use Shift Right/Left instead of Division/Multiplication if possible

At [Line](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/Locker.sol#L82)
`And many other lines as below mentioned`

## Summary
A division/multiplication by any number x being a power of 2 can be calculated by shifting log2(x) to the right/left.

## Vulnerability Detail
A division/multiplication by any number x being a power of 2 can be calculated by shifting log2(x) to the right/left.

While the DIV opcode uses 5 gas, the SHR opcode only uses 3 gas. Furthermore, Solidity's division operation also includes a division-by-0 prevention which is bypassed using shifting.

#### Findings:
```solidity
isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol::23 => uint256 public constant CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY = 200; //2 days
isomorph/contracts/Locker.sol::63 => *           must be less than or equal to 4 years (4*365*24*60*60 = 126144000)
isomorph/contracts/Locker.sol::82 => *           must exceed current lock and must be less than or equal to 4 years (4*365*24*60*60 = 126144000)
```

## Impact
While the DIV opcode uses 5 gas, the SHR opcode only uses 3 gas. Furthermore, Solidity's division operation also includes a division-by-0 prevention which is bypassed using shifting.

## Code Snippet
Example
ğŸ¤¦ Bad:

uint256 b = a / 2;
uint256 c = a / 4;
uint256 d = a * 8;
ğŸš€ Good:

uint256 b = a >> 1;
uint256 c = a >> 2;
uint256 d = a << 3;
