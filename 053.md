# Depositor.sol: Allowing withdrawals when Depositor is approved is unsafe and can lead to loss of funds

## Summary
The `Depositor.withdrawFromGauge` function [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/Depositor.sol#L119](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/Depositor.sol#L119) is used to withdraw funds from the gauge by burning the deposit receipt NFT.

Any user can call the function but in order to succeed the Depositor must either be the owner of the NFT or the Depositor must be approved to burn the NFT.

The approval/ownership is checked in the `DepositReceipt_Base.burn` function (which is called by the Depositor).

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L110-L111](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L110-L111)

So in order for the call to succeed, the `Depositor` must be the owner of the NFT or it must be approved.
This is unsafe because if the `Depositor` is the owner or approved, any user can then call `Depositor.withdrawFromGauge` and withdraw the funds.

One might say that as long as the transfer of ownership to the Depositor or the approval of the Depositor and after that the withdrawal happen within the same transaction, there is no issue.

This is true. However I think it is fair to assume that in reality this assumption does often not hold. 
E.g. an EOA cannot in the same transaction approve the depositor and withdraw the funds, which means there is time for an attacker to withdraw the funds.

Also the issue can easily be mitigated by the approach outlined in the "Recommendation" section.

## Vulnerability Detail
See above section.

## Impact
By approving the `Depositor` to burn the NFT or transferring the NFT to the `Depositor`, anyone can call `Depositor.withdrawFromGauge` and withdraw the funds.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of checking `_isApprovedOrOwner` with the `msg.sender` (which is the Depositor), the Depositor should send the original `msg.sender` (the one calling `Depositor.withdrawFromGauge`) in a parameter to the `DepositReceipt_Base.burn` function. `_isApprovedOrOwner` should then be called with this parameter.

Thereby it is checked that the address from which `Depositor.withdrawFromGauge` is called is the owner of the NFT or is approved.
