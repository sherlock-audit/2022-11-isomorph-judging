# Admins could add the previous role immediately after calling `removeRole`

## Summary

If an admin removes a role, another admin can call `addRole` to add it back in no time to bypass the time delay.

## Vulnerability Detail

`addRole` function doesn't clean `action_queued`, thus any admins can set it back.

1. Suppose Alice and Bob are admins, if Alice proposed `proposeAddRole` and called `addRole(Eve, A_ROLE)` after the time delay. Now Eve has A_ROLE.
2. Bob wants to remove Eve, so Bob calls `removeRole(Eve, A_ROLE)`
3. Alice can call `addRole(Eve, A_ROLE)` in no time to add Eve back to bypass the time delay.

## Impact

Admins can bypass time delay to add roles.

## Recommendation

Add a mapping to record that `action_hash` is accomplished.
