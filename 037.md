# Vault_Lyra doesn't allow to close loan if Lyra collateral is not active and accrues more fees

## Summary
If Lyra collateral asset is not active then Vault_Lyra will not allow for borrower to close his loan and will continue accumulate fees for him.
## Vulnerability Detail
Vault_Lyra.closeLoan allows user to repay his loan. One of the checking that it makes is check if Lyra collateral asset [is active](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L226).

```solidity
    function _checkIfCollateralIsActive(bytes32 _currencyKey) internal view override {
            
             //Lyra LP tokens use their associated LiquidityPool to check if they're active
             ILiquidityPoolAvalon LiquidityPool = ILiquidityPoolAvalon(collateralBook.liquidityPoolOf(_currencyKey));
             bool isStale;
             uint circuitBreakerExpiry;
             //ignore first output as this is the token price and not needed yet.
             (, isStale, circuitBreakerExpiry) = LiquidityPool.getTokenPriceWithCheck();
             require( !(isStale), "Global Cache Stale, can't trade");
             require(circuitBreakerExpiry < block.timestamp, "Lyra Circuit Breakers active, can't trade");
    }
```
In case if asset is not active then function will revert and will not allow borrower to repay his loan.
As result user can't close loan and interests are still accruing. User will pay more fees then he expected when asset will be active again.

I believe that in such case protocol should allow user to close loan or stop accruing fees.

Also the same problem is present in Vault_Synth contract, it's also checking if collateral is active for each operation.
## Impact
Borrower can't close his loan, but fees are still accruing.

## Recommendation
Do not allow to make new loan or increase collateral if asset is not active, but allow user to close his loan or stop calculating interests for him.
