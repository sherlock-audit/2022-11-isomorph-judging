# Anyone can steal `AMMToken` from **Depositer** contract

## Summary

With the function `withdrawFromGauge` an attacker can steal `AMMToken` funds of the **Depositer** contract and burn the **DepositReceipt_USDC** ERC721 token of the owner

## Vulnerability Detail

When a normal user deploy a **Depositor** contract and deposit with `depositToGauge`, the contract creates a NFT to manage the deposit
The function `withdrawFromGauge` is used to burn this NFT and take the rewards from the gauge and the deposit `AMMToken` amount
To use this function the owner of the NFT [need approves the **Depositor** contract to manage it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Velo-Deposit-Tokens/contracts/DepositReceipt_Base.sol#L111) to be able to use the function `withdrawFromGauge`, in that moment an attacker have the possibility to execute the function `withdrawFromGauge` and take the deposit `AMMToken` amount for himself and with this burn the NFT and the owner stop receive rewards
> Note: the rewards still can be recuperate by the owner with the function `claimRewards`

## Impact

An attacker can steal `AMMToken` funds of the **Depositer** contract and burn the **DepositReceipt_USDC** ERC721 token of the owner
