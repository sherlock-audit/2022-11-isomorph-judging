# Vaults can interact to a collateral with different AssetType

## Summary

It is possible to interact with collateral that has a different assetType than a vault, it breaks the invariant:

- Vaults should only be able to interact with the collateral relating to their AssetType

## Vulnerability Detail

When either opening a loan, increasing collateral, closing a loan, or liquidating a loan, the user can use collateral with assetType different from the vault, because there isn't any check validating the vault and collateral type.

## Impact

Depending on the vault and the collateral configuration is possible to interact with different liquidity pools.

## Code Snippet

When either opening loan or increasing collateral or closing a loan or liquidating a loan the check of collateral is made by the `_collateralExists` function and checks if

```solidity
function _collateralExists(address _collateralAddress) internal {
    require(collateralBook.collateralValid(_collateralAddress), "Unsupported collateral!");
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to check if collateral assetType is equal to vault assetType in `openLoan`, `increaseCollateralAmount`, `closeLoan`, and `callLiquidation`, adding a new verification function:

```solidity
function _collateralAssetTypeValid(uint256 _assetType) internal {	
  require(collateralBook.vaults(_assetType) == address(this), "Unsupported collateral");
}
```
