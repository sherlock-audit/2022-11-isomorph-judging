# Assets can get locked as functions won't be able to withdraw

# Assets can get locked as functions won't be able to withdraw
## Summary
Assets can get lock if wrong values used
## Vulnerability Detail
Constructor doesn't check for `0x0` being used as an address, this would cause functions as `transferNFTs`, `claimBribesMultiNFTs` not work as for example if `voter` is set to 0.

After a time of being deploy, when first function with one of this addresses set to 0x0 being called, functioning won't be the expected one.

If for example `voter` is set to `0x0`, most of the functions for voting or withdrawing rewards or nfts won't work.
## Impact
Functions that affects assets not working, value locked, force of redeploy if immutable address wrongly set on `voter` and other addresses
