# Vault_Lyra.sol - priceCollateralToUSD : Calculated USD value could be less due to solidity integer division truncation.

## Summary

In Vault_Lyra contract, function `priceCollateralToUSD` function is used to determine the actual USD for the respective collateral.

In this function at line 86, before multiplication division is done. this is know to integer divison truncation in solidity. Due to this, the calculated value could be lesser than actual value.

[Line-86](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L86)

        uint256 USDValueAfterFee = USDValue * (LOAN_SCALE- withdrawalFee)/LOAN_SCALE;

## Impact

This could affect in following places.

openLoan : impact on margin calculation.

increaseCollateralAmount: Liquidation margin check.

The impacts could be like,

1. Less loan value.
2. early liquidation due to less value calculation.
3. increase collateral will be slightly less.

## Recommendation

        -uint256 USDValueAfterFee = USDValue * (LOAN_SCALE- withdrawalFee)/LOAN_SCALE;

        +uint256 USDValueAfterFee = (USDValue * (LOAN_SCALE- withdrawalFee))/LOAN_SCALE;
