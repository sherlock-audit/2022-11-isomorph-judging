# Minimum ratio can be set too close to liquidation ratio

## Summary
`CollateralBook.sol` allows to set minimum ration really close to liquidation ratio. This can lead to user errors opening loans that are too close to liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The only check performed on these values is 
```solidity
require(_minimumRatio > _liquidationRatio);
```
I believe this is not enough and a bigger margin need to be considered

## Impact
Users might be prone to opening loans really close to liquidation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check that `_minimumRatio` is reasonably higher than `_liquidationRatio`. For example:
```solidity
require(_minimumRatio > _liquidationRatio * 1.05 ether / 1 ether);
```
