# Vault_synth accepts lyra collateral in closeLoan call

## Summary
Since the check for collateral existence and validity is centralized for all vaults, it is possible if other external checks pass (such as synth market enabled), to pass some type of collateral to a vault which should not accept it.
One example of this is it is possible to call `closeLoan` on synth vault with zero amounts without reverting.
