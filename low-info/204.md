# Unused require statement in `changeCollateralType()`

## Summary
Unused require statement in `changeCollateralType()`

## Vulnerability Detail
As how it is the require statement is only useful for the first time someone calls `changeCollateralType()`.
`require(submissionTimestamp != 0, "Uninitialized collateral change");`
Every time the function is called and collatoral type is changed, the variable `submissionTimestamp` should be updated to zero.
So the function can't be called second time overriding the same params. The issue doesn't lead to anything bad tho.

## Impact
The require statement in `changeCollateralType()` should be used, so no one can call the function and override the same params.
