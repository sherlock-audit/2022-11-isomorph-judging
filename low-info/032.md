# Vault_Base_ERC20.setOpenLoanFee should also use VAULT_TIME_DELAY to change fee

## Summary
Vault_Base_ERC20.setOpenLoanFee doesn't use VAULT_TIME_DELAY to change fee. It allows to do that instantly. As protocol is aiming to give users time to adjust to new rules it should also change fee only after VAULT_TIME_DELAY.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L107-L113
```solidity
    function setOpenLoanFee(uint256 _newOpenLoanFee) external onlyAdmin {
        require(_newOpenLoanFee <= 1 ether /10 ); 
        emit ChangeOpenLoanFee(_newOpenLoanFee, loanOpenFee); //ignoring CEI pattern here
        loanOpenFee = _newOpenLoanFee;
    }
```
Vault_Base_ERC20.setOpenLoanFee function allows to change fee for opening new loan. As you can see it changes the fee instantly. However the protocol is aiming to give users some time to adjust to new rules before the changes. That's why this function should also be implemented in such way that new fee can be set after some time it was proposed.
## Impact
User do not have enough time to react on changes.
