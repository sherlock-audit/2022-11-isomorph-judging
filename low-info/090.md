# withdrawFromGauge() may cause the user to be unable to withdraw

## Summary
withdrawFromGauge() may cause the user to be unable to withdraw
## Vulnerability Detail
In withdrawFromGauge, the user can pass in the `_tokens` array, but this parameter has nothing to do with the user. Because he will call `gauge.getReward()`. Rewards for updating the `Depositor` contract. And these operations have no benefit for the user. But users need to consume gas for contract rewards. If the array is too long, it will still cause insufficient gas. Affects the user's normal withdraw.
```solidity
    function withdrawFromGauge(uint256 _NFTId, address[] memory _tokens)  public  {
        uint256 amount = depositReceipt.pooledTokens(_NFTId);
        depositReceipt.burn(_NFTId);
        gauge.getReward(address(this), _tokens); //@audit  
        gauge.withdraw(amount);
        //AMMToken adheres to ERC20 spec meaning it reverts on failure, no need to check return
        //slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
        AMMToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
