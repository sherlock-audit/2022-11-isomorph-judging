# Missed require statements

## Summary
There is no check in `viewVirtualPriceforAsset()` and `viewLastUpdateTimeforAsset()` methods
## Vulnerability Detail
Provided address potentially can be the zero address, hence it would be appropriate to have a `require` statement
## Impact
Low as it will not change the protocol's behaviour
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
I would recommend to add a `require` statement to check if `address != address(0)`
