# Users can spam mint new NFTs in the function `split` in DepositReceipt_Base providing zero as _percentageSplit.

## Summary
Users can spam mint new NFTs in the function `split` in DepositReceipt_Base providing zero as _percentageSplit.

## Vulnerability Detail
l can't see how this will lead to anything bad, as how it is right now the only problem is that the variable `currentLastId` can be spammed like that. Certainly from looking over the code, splitting a NFT with zero _percentageSplit is forbidden, but the split function is lacking this require statement in DepositReceipt_Base.
