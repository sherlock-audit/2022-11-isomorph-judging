# Vault_Velo.sol : In open loan , the existing loan value could be less than actual due to integer division truncation

## Summary

openLoan function is used to either creating new loan or adding on an existing loan.

If the user already has loan, then the loan value is shown as lesser than what is actually has.

## Vulnerability Detail

While calculating the existing loan value, division is done before multiplication. It is knows to truncation. Hence the existing loan value could be lesser than actual one.

## Code Snippet

Refer vulnerability section.

## Recommendation

            -uint256 existingLoan = isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice /LOAN_SCALE;

            +uint256 existingLoan = (isoUSDLoanAndInterest[_collateralAddress][msg.sender] * virtualPrice) /LOAN_SCALE;
