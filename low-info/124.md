# partialWithdrawFromGauge has reentrancy issue.

## Summary

This report details a vulnerability in the partialWithdrawFromGauge function of a smart contract. The issue is a re-entrancy attack that can be exploited by a malicious contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The partialWithdrawFromGauge function is vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks. This function calls the split function, which calls the _mintNewNFT function. The _mintNewNFT function in turn calls the safeMint function, which is vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks if the NFT receiver is a contract that implements the onERC721Received hook.

## Impact

A successful re-entrancy attack on this contract could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the contract, potentially allowing the attacker to steal funds or manipulate the contract's state.
