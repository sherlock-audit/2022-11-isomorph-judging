# Consider external functions contracts trying to hijack control flow after an external call.

## Summary
This external entity is now in charge of the control flow and can execute any inherent code, in case it is another contract. Most of the times, this will not cause any problems, but in case the called contract is acting in bad faith, it could alter the control flow and return it in an unexpected state to the initial contract. A possible attack vector is a re-entrancy attack, in which the malicious contract is reentering the initial contract, before the first instance of the function containing the call is finished. aims to provide a safe solution, in order to make functions unassailable against re-entrancy attacks of any form.

## Vulnerability Detail
Participating entities in this pattern are the called function, as well as the calling party, which will gain the control flow, for example in the case a value transfer is happening. While the pattern is solely implemented in the called function, the other party is a essential participant, as it has the potential to manipulate the control flow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider there are two possible mitigations. First is to use the [openzeppelin reentrancy guard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) over the on Code Snippet function which will prevent multiple  being made simultaneously.

The second mitigation is to follow the [checks-effects-interactions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/security-considerations.html#re-entrancy) pattern. This would involve updating all state variables before making any external calls.
