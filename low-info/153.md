# Security vulnerabilities in contract Vault_Base_ERC20

At [Line](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/blob/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L85)

## Summary
   The contract **Vault_Base_ERC20** contains several security vulnerabilities that could allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions.
 
   The contract has a **pause()** function that can be called by any user with the **PAUSER_ROLE**. This could allow a malicious user to pause the contract and prevent legitimate users from interacting with it.

   The contract allows anyone with the **ADMIN_ROLE** to update the **treasury** address, which could be used to redirect fees and other payments to a malicious account.
 
   The contract allows users to open loans and post collateral, but it does not include any mechanism to prevent a user from posting insufficient collateral to cover their loan. This could lead to a situation where the contract becomes insolvent.
   
   The contract uses the **block.timestamp** variable to track the current day, but this is not a reliable source of time information in a blockchain. A malicious user could potentially manipulate the **block.timestamp** to bypass the daily limits on loan opening.

## Vulnerability Detail
1.Deploy the contract Vault_Base_ERC20 on a test network.
2. Call the pause() function with a user that has the PAUSER_ROLE role.
3. Attempt to interact with the contract as a legitimate user.
4. Call the updateTreasury() function with a user that has the ADMIN_ROLE role and provide a malicious address as the new treasury address.
5. Open a loan and post insufficient collateral to cover the loan.
6. Manipulate the block.timestamp variable to bypass the daily loan limit.

## Impact
The security vulnerabilities in the **Vault_Base_ERC20** contract could allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions, potentially leading to a loss of funds or other damages for the contract and its users. These vulnerabilities include the ability to pause the contract, redirect fees and other payments to a malicious account, open loans with insufficient collateral, and bypass the daily loan limit.

Expected result:

    The pause() function should not be accessible to all users with the PAUSER_ROLE role.
    The updateTreasury() function should not be accessible to users other than the contract owner.
    The contract should prevent users from opening loans with insufficient collateral.
    The contract should use a reliable source of time information to track the current day.

Actual result:

    The pause() function can be called by any user with the PAUSER_ROLE role, allowing a malicious user to pause the contract and prevent legitimate users from interacting with it.
    The updateTreasury() function can be called by any user with the ADMIN_ROLE role, allowing a malicious user to redirect fees and other payments to a malicious account.
    The contract does not prevent users from opening loans with insufficient collateral, potentially leading to insolvency.
    The contract uses the block.timestamp variable to track the current day, which can be manipulated by a malicious user to bypass the daily loan limit.

## Code Snippet
   Remove the **pause()** function or restrict it so that it can only be called by a trusted account (such as the contract owner):
```solidity
// Remove the pause function
// function pause() external {
//     bool validUser = hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
//     require(validUser, "Only ADMIN_ROLE can pause the contract");
//     _pause();
// }

// OR

// Restrict the pause function to only be called by the contract owner
function pause() external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can pause the contract");
    _pause();
}
```

Include a check in the loan opening functions to ensure that the user has posted sufficient collateral to cover the loan:
```solidity
function openLoan(bytes32 collateralToken, uint256 isoUSDLoan) external {
    // Check that the user has posted sufficient collateral to cover the loan
    uint256 collateralAmount = collateralBook.getCollateral(msg.sender, collateralToken);
    require(collateralAmount >= isoUSDLoan, "Insufficient collateral to cover the loan");

    ...
}
```

Use a more reliable source of time information, such as the **block.timestamp** provided by the OpenZeppelin **Pausable** contract, instead of the **block.timestamp** variable:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";

abstract contract Vault_Base_ERC20 is RoleControl(VAULT_TIME_DELAY), Pausable {
    ...

    // Use the block.timestamp provided by the Pausable contract
    // uint256 public dayCounter = block.timestamp;
    uint256 public dayCounter = block.timestamp();

    ...
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation:
To fix the security vulnerabilities in the **Vault_Base_ERC20** contract, I would recommend removing the **pause()** function or restricting it to only be called by a trusted account, preventing the **treasury** address from being changed by anyone other than the contract owner, adding a check to ensure that users have posted sufficient collateral when opening a loan, and using a more reliable source of time information. These changes will help to prevent unauthorized access and actions, and protect the contract and its users from potential losses.
