# Missing functions to rescue ERC20 tokens

## Summary
The `Vault` contracts (Velo, Synths, Lyra) and the `Depositor` contract are made to handle ERC20 transfers.
The contracts only pull tokens from the users, the users don't have to push tokens to the contracts.

However in case users make a mistake and push payments, their funds are lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Depositor` contract is owned by a single user. So this user should be able to rescue any tokens that are sent accidentally to the contract.
The `Vault` contracts should allow the `admin` to rescue ERC20 tokens.

Rescuing native tokens must not be considered because none of the functions in the contracts is payable.

## Impact
Users that push payments to the `Vault` contracts or the `Depositor` lose their funds.

## Recommendation
Implement functions to rescue ERC20 tokens in the `Vault` and `Depositor` contracts.
