# Locker.lockVELO emits GenerateVeNFT event with wrong _lockDuration

## Summary
Locker.lockVELO emits GenerateVeNFT event with wrong _lockDuration, because votingEscrow.create_lock rounds down to week provided values. As result all systems that track that event will get wrong info.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function lockVELO(uint256 _tokenAmount, uint256 _lockDuration) external onlyOwner {
        //approve transfer of VELO to votingEscrow contract, bad pattern, prefer increaseApproval but VotingEscrow is not upgradable so should be ok
        //VELO.approve returns true always so it is of no use.
        //slither-disable-next-line unused-return
        velo.approve(address(votingEscrow), _tokenAmount);
        //create lock
        uint256 NFTId = votingEscrow.create_lock(_tokenAmount, _lockDuration);
        //store new NFTId for reference
        veNFTIds.push(NFTId);
        emit GenerateVeNFT(NFTId, _tokenAmount, _lockDuration);


    }
```

Locker.lockVELO function allows owner to lock VELO tokens in VotingEscrow. _lockDuration param is the period that should be used to lock tokens. Later this param is used to emit GenerateVeNFT event.
But as you can see [here](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/master/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L767) VotingEscrow rounds down block.timestamp + _lock_duration to weeks and that means that lock duration is actually not the same as it it provided.
As result GenerateVeNFT event fires with wrong _lockDuration param.
## Impact
GenerateVeNFT event fires with wrong _lockDuration param.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the locked duration as it is done is VotingEscrow.
uint256 realLockDuration = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp + _lock_duration) / WEEK * WEEK;
