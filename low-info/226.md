# Wrong `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` value

## Summary
Wrong `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` value
## Vulnerability Detail
`CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` is set to 200 seconds instead of 2 days as specified in the comment ([CollateralBook.sol#L23](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L23)):
```solidity
uint256 public constant CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY = 200; //2 days
```
## Impact
The admin of `CollateralBook` is able to change collateral properties more often than documented.
