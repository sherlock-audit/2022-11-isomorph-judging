# `TIME_DELAY` misconfiguration for isoUSDToken and CollateralBook

## Summary

In `isoUSDToken` the value for `ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY` in inherit `RoleControl` is set to a wrong value and for *` CollateralBook` the value for `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` is set to the wrong value*

## Vulnerability Detail

Both contracts have their delay for time lock operation with the wrong value, the value of the `ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY` constant is set to `3` but the correct value should be `3 days` and for *` CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY` the value is set to `200` but should be set to  `2 days`*

## Impact

The `isoUSDToken` inherits `RoleControl` functions to update roles considering a `TIME_DELAY` value given in the constructor and not possible to change. The doc says that `isoUSD` is "… The addition of a new `MINTER`is also protected by a 3 day timelock as a security measure." which is invalid because it is set to 3 seconds.

The CollateralBook has a time lock control to accept the update of collateral and should be set to `2 days`

```solidity
uint256 constant ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY = 3; //days;
```

[CollateralBook.sol#L23](https://github.com/kree-dotcom/isomorph/tree/789338c8979ab75b8187781a2500908bb26dcdea/contracts/CollateralBook.sol#L23)

```solidity
uint256 public constant CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY = 200; //2 days
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to fix the values of `ISOUSD_TIME_DELAY` and `CHANGE_COLLATERAL_DELAY`
