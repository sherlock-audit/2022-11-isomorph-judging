# `PendingTreasury` is never set to address 0 after setting

## Summary
The `Vault_Base_ERC20` contract allows for changing of a treasury address in a two step process. The admin will have to call `proposeTreasury ()` function first with the `newTreasury` address. Thereafter, after the timelock period has elapsed, the admin then calls `setTreasury ()` function where the `pendingTreasury` is set to the treasury address. However, the contract does not thereafter set the `pendingTreasury` to 0 meaning that anytime the admin calls the `setTreasury` function, the already set `pendingTreasury` will always be set.
## Vulnerability Detail
Not setting the `pendingTreasury` to `address(0)` after setting treasury is a security risk as it allows the `pendingTreasury` to have the ability of becoming the treasury forever and defies the two step change mechanism

## Impact
The `pendingTreasury` is set forever and can be called anytime in the future without undergoing the two step change mechanism

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing the `setTreasury ()` function as follows:
```Solidity
 function setTreasury() external onlyAdmin {
        require(updateTreasuryTimestamp < block.timestamp); 
        address copyOfPendingTreasury = pendingTreasury;
        require(copyOfPendingTreasury != address(0));
        emit ChangeTreasury(treasury, copyOfPendingTreasury); //ignoring CEI pattern here
        treasury = copyOfPendingTreasury;
        pendingTreasury = address(0);
    }
```
