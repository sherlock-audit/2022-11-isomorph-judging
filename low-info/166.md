# CALL() SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD OF TRANSFER() ON AN ADDRESS PAYABLE

## Summary
CALL() SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD OF TRANSFER() ON AN ADDRESS PAYABLE
## Vulnerability Detail
The use of the deprecated transfer() function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.
Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.
