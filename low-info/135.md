# Role is not set

## Summary
Missing a mechanism to set the role
## Vulnerability Detail
Role `MINTER_ROLE` exists in `isoUSDToken.sol` but there is no way of setting it
## Impact
Nobody would be able to mint and burn an isoUSDToken as `msg.sender` of these functions has to be `MINTER_ROLE`
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
I would recommend to implement a mechanism to be able to set the variable of `MINTER_ROLE`. Maybe from the constructor and set the `msg.sender` (the deployer of the contract) to have this role
