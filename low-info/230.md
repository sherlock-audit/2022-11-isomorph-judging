# Questionable assumption/approach

## Summary
There is a comment right above the [following line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Lyra.sol#L314) 
`if a user is being fully liquidated we will forgive any remaining debt so it doesn't roll over if they open a new loan of the same collateral.`
## Vulnerability Detail
This assumption and kind of approach might lead to the whole protocol being insolvent if too many users are being liquidated entirely and any remaining debt is being mitigated
## Impact

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
I would recommend to implement a mechanism which will prevent the protocol of going insolvent. This might inlcude a vault per user of still present debt and implement some kind of logic to partially or entirely pay out the debt throughout the time. Maybe denominated in `isoUSD token`
