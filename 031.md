# Bypassing fees by manipulating `_loanAmount`

## Summary
Bypassing fees by manipulating `_loanAmount`
## Vulnerability Detail
`_increaseLoan()` is a function to increase the user's isoUSD by calculating the `_loanAmount` passed in by the user. Calculate the isoUSD amount of mint, one part is given to the user, and the other part is given to the treasury.

```solidity
    function _increaseLoan(uint256 _loanAmount) internal {
        uint256 userMint;
        uint256 loanFee;
        _checkDailyMaxLoans(_loanAmount);
        (userMint, loanFee) = _findFees(loanOpenFee, _loanAmount);
        isoUSD.mint(_loanAmount);
        //isoUSD reverts on transfer failure so we can safely ignore slither's warnings for it.
        //slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
        isoUSD.transfer(msg.sender, userMint);
        //slither-disable-next-line unchecked-transfer
        isoUSD.transfer(treasury, loanFee);
    }
```
The function to calculate the handling fee here is `_findFees()`

```solidity
    function _findFees(uint256 _percentToPay, uint256 _amount) internal pure returns(uint256, uint256){
        uint256 feeToPay = ((_amount * _percentToPay) / LOAN_SCALE); // @audit 
        uint256 postFees = _amount - feeToPay; //if the user loan is too small this will revert
        return (postFees, feeToPay);
    }
```
Among them, `_percentToPay` is `loanOpenFee`, which is 0.01 ether, and `LOAN_SCALE` is 1 ether. But solidity is rounded. If `(_amount * _percentToPay)` is less than `LOAN_SCALE`, then `feeToPay` will be 0, thereby bypassing the fee collection. All isoUSD will be sent to the user

The user can call the function multiple times to bypass the handling fee under the premise of not exceeding the daily maximum `dailyMax`
