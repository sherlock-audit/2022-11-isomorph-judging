# `_updateVirtualPrice` After Prolonged Inactivity Will Brick Vaults

## Summary
In `Vault_Base_ERC20.sol`, the `_updateVirtualPrice` function is called whenever the latest price is fetched in order to update the most up-to-date price. The `threeMinuteDelta` variable increments every 3 minutes, and is looped over to update the virtual price for each three minutes. But, this execution could run out of gas due to inactivity.

`Vault_Base_ERC20.sol` LN#212
```solidity
uint256 timeDelta = _currentBlockTime - lastUpdateTime;
//exit gracefully if two users call the function for the same collateral in the same 3min period
uint256 threeMinuteDelta = timeDelta / 180; 
```
## Vulnerability Detail
The problem lies in the `threeMinuteDelta` delta calculation. Looping over the size of this variable could soon turn very sour when if a certain vault implements this contract and functions and goes inactive for an extended period of time - all funds and operations will be lost.

In a lesser extent, even if it does not run out of gas - the end user will burn enormous funds on gas to front the operation costs. Users may even backrun/wait for another user to front the bill.

`Vault_Base_ERC20.sol` LN#215
```solidity
if(threeMinuteDelta > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < threeMinuteDelta; i++ ){
            virtualPrice = (virtualPrice * interestPer3Min) / LOAN_SCALE; 
            }
            collateralBook.vaultUpdateVirtualPriceAndTime(_collateralAddress, virtualPrice, _currentBlockTime);
        }
```

It also appears that the problem has been considered, but due to the immense implications it puts on every vault it should not be taken lightly, especially if one is used less.

`Vault_Base_ERC20.sol` LN#202
```js
/// @dev currently uses interest calculations per 3 minutes to save gas and prevent DOS loop situations
```

## Impact
Since `Vault_Lyra.sol`, `Vault_Synths.sol`, and `Vault_Velo.sol` all inherit from `Vault_Base_ERC20.sol` and use the `_updateVirtualPrice` for opening, closing, and interacting with loans, once the `threeMinuteDelta` gets to an unreachable number they will no longer be intractable as every transaction will revert before reaching success.

In this state, the only thing that users can do is to liquidate loans.

## Recommendation

Set an upper limit for `threeMinuteDelta`.
