# Transferring collateral to the contract could fail when opening a loan or increasing the collateral.

## Summary
Transferring collateral to the contract could fail when opening a loan or increasing the collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
In **Vault_Synths** contract, when the user opens a loan, it should increase the collateral by transferring colAmount from the user to the contract. 
The contract calls  `_increaseCollateral()` Inherited from **Vault_Base_ERC20** contract. 
 `_increaseCollateral()` calls `transferFrom` of the collateral token and expecting a boolean returned value **true** for non-reverting ERC20 failures as follows:

```sh
 function _increaseCollateral(IERC20 _collateral, uint256 _colAmount) internal {
   bool success  =_collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _colAmount);
   //due to contract size we cannot use SafeERC20 so we check for non-reverting ERC20 failures
   require(success);
        
 }
```

However, the returned value will be **false** if the ERC20 token doesn't return a value, resulting in a revert as **success** always required to be **true**.

Note: this is applicable on other parts where the same logic is used.


## Impact
- ERC20 Tokens that don't return a value will be unusable.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph/blob/main/contracts/Isomorph/contracts/Vault_Base_ERC20.sol#L244-L249

```sh
    function _increaseCollateral(IERC20 _collateral, uint256 _colAmount) internal {
        bool success  =_collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _colAmount);
        //due to contract size we cannot use SafeERC20 so we check for non-reverting ERC20 failures
        require(success);
        
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only require **success** to be **true** if there is returned data. Basically, the same check a library such as openzeppelin does.
