# `changeCollateralType()` can still be called even in paused state

## Summary
I believe the purpose of the timelock is to allow users to have enough time to react to a `queueCollateralChange()` call. However, the timelock can be circumvented by the admin by making use of `pauseCollateralType()` 

## Vulnerability Detail
We notice the lack of `collateralExists` modifier in `changeCollateralType()` but it is there for `queueCollateralChange()`. This means that if admin calls `queueCollateralChange()`, pauses the collateral type, they can wait for the needed time to pass and change the collateral type. This defeats the purpose of the timelock as users will still not have sufficient time to react to this important change since important functions in the vaults such as `closeLoan()` are all disabled when protocol is paused.

## Impact
I believe the protocol wants to reduce the trust assumptions of the admin user as much as possible as seen in the implementation of timelock. However, due to the pause functionality, a compromised admin account can still make changes without giving users any chances to react to by disabling their interactions with the vault. We note that `changeCollateralType()` is a highly privileged function as it changes many important properties of the collateral as mentioned in my other issue #8. Hence, I find medium severity to be valid here.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend using another variable to keep track of the total time paused for a particular collateral. Also, we should only allow `changeCollateralType()` when it is not paused. When we unpause the collateral, we want to extend the `submissionTimestamp` by this total paused time, to account for the paused state. This way, a compromised admin account cannot abuse this to change collateral type.
