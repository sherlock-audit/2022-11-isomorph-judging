# Insufficient isoUSD supply to pay back loans

## Summary
isoUSD is only minted when a loan is created.
The amount of isoUSD that is created with a loan is equal to the loan's principal.
However the amount of isoUSD that needs to be paid back is equal to the principal + interest. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine User A takes a loan of $100. This means that 100 isoUSD are minted.
With an interest rate of 5% per year, after 1 year User A needs to pay back 105 isoUSD. But the difference of 5 isoUSD never got minted!

When there are many users of the system the effects of this might not be visible immediately for an increasing amount of isoUSD can temporarily disguise the fact that there is not enough isoUSD.

However when many people take loans there will also be an ever increasing amount of interest (and an ever increasing discrepancy between isoUSD minted and isoUSD that need to be paid back eventually).

As soon as there is not a sufficient amount of fresh loans to satisfy the need for isoUSD, the system will collapse.

The shortage of isoUSD will then lead to credit defaults.

Also there is a pressure for the price of isoUSD to increase beyond $1 because the loans are over-collateralized. So by paying back 1 isoUSD a user will get back more than $1.

## Impact
I labelled this issue as "High" because I think it is a fatal flaw in the project's design and makes any long-term adoption impossible.
Especially when users become reluctant to take new loans (e.g. when we transition from a bull market into a bear market).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Explore how the system can be made more robust in terms of economic incentives.
There is probably no best way to do it but it is foreseeable that the way the system is set up right now, it will collapse at some point.
