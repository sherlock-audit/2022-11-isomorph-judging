# priceLiquidity may revert in directional market conditions preventing legitimate liquidations

## Summary

In the case a token collapses in value against USDC, there are strong chances that the pool will not be aligned with the oracle value. In that case, liquidators would not be able to call `callLiquidation`  because of the boundary check in `priceLiquidity`.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
This is a legitimate case where the user which has deposited LP tokens should get liquidated, but liquidators are unable to do so. This leads to bad debt for the protocol.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of implementing a custom flash loan protection, it would be safer to use fair LP token pricing described here:

It is not manipulatable by using a flash loan because imbalancing the pool does not increase the value of LP tokens.
